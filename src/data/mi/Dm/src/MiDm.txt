<h2>(MiDm01) Mahāpajāpatī’s story</h2>

<lzh>爾時世尊還歸舍夷，未至迦維羅衛城，止尼拘類樹下。淨飯王出迎，遙見世尊容顏殊特，猶若金山，前禮佛足，而說偈言：</lzh>
At that time, the World-honored One was returning to the Sakyans, and when he hadn’t yet reached Kapilavatthu, he stopped under a Banyan tree. King Suddhodana came out to welcome him, and he saw from afar that the World-honored One’s features were exquisite, like a golden mountain. First he paid respect at the Buddha’s feet, and then he spoke this verse:

<lzh-verse>「生時相師記，
我聞致初敬，	
樹傾時稽首，
道成今三禮。」	</lzh-verse>
<verse>At birth, a fortune-teller made a prediction
I heard it and paid respect the first time.
When the tree bent, I worshipped you (again).<note>This refers to the Buddha meditating as a child under the rose-apple tree.</note>
Now that you’ve accomplished the path, I bow the third time.</verse>

<lzh>說此偈已，却坐一面。佛為說種種妙法，乃至見法得果。從坐起，偏袒右肩，䠒跪合掌，白佛言：「世尊！願與我出家受具足戒。」佛即觀之，見王出家更無所得，便白王言：「莫放逸！次第自當得此妙法。」於是求受三歸五戒。受五戒已，佛更為說種種妙法，示教利喜，還歸所住。王歸宮已，庭中三唱：「若欲於如來正法律中出家者聽。」</lzh>
When he had spoken this verse, he sat at one side. The Buddha spoke all kinds of marvelous dhamma, until he saw the dhamma and attained the fruit. He rose from his seat, uncovered his right shoulder, knelt down, joined his palms, and told the Buddha: “World-honored One, please give me the going forth and the full ordination.” The Buddha then examined this, and saw that if the king went forth, he still wouldn’t attain anything. Then he told the kind: “Don’t be negligent. Gradually, you wil attain this marvelous dhamma yourself.” At this, he asked to receive the three refuges and five precepts. When he had received the five precepts, the Buddha still spoke all kinds of marvelous dhamma. He benefitted from and delighted in the instruction, and returned to his residence. When the king had returned to his palace, he announced three times in the courtyard: “If someone wants to go forth in the Tathāgata’s true dhamma and vinaya, I allow it.”

<lzh>時摩訶波闍波提瞿曇彌聞王此唱，即與五百釋女前後圍繞，持二新衣出到佛所，頭面禮足，白佛言：「世尊！我自織此衣，今以奉上，願垂納受！」佛言：「可以施僧，得大果報！」復如上白，佛言：「可以施僧，我在僧數。」復如上白，佛言：「我受一，以一施僧。」然後受教，施佛及僧。瞿曇彌復白佛言：「願聽女人於佛正法出家受具足戒！」佛言：「止，止，莫作是語！所以者何？往古諸佛皆不聽女人出家。諸女人輩自依於佛，在家剃頭著袈裟衣，勤行精進，得獲道果。未來諸佛，亦復如是。我今聽汝以此為法！」瞿曇彌如上三請，佛亦如上三不聽許。於是瞿曇彌便大啼哭，禮足而退。</lzh>
Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī heard the announcement of the king, and surrounded everywhere by 500 Sakyan women, she took two new robes and went out to where the Buddha was. She paid respect with her head at his feet, and told the Buddha: “World-honored One, I’ve myself woven these robes, and now present them to you. Please consent to receiving them.” The Buddha said: “Please offer them to the sangha. You’ll obtain great merit.” She again said the same as above, and the Buddha said: “Please offer them to the sangha. I’m also included in the sangha.” She again said the same as above, and the Buddha said: “I receive one, and you offer one to the sangha.” Then she accepted the instruction and offered to the Buddha and the sangha. Gotamī again said to the Buddha: “Please allow women to go forth and receive the full ordination in the Buddha’s true dhamma.” The Buddha said: “Stop, stop, don’t say this. Why? The previous Buddhas all didn’t allow women to go forth. The women, relying on the Buddha, shaved their heads and wore monastic robes at home. Striving diligently, they attained the paths and fruits. The future Buddhas will also do it like this. I now allow you to follow this method.” Gotamī asked him three times as above, and the Buddha also didn’t allow it three times as above. At this, Gotamī cried loudly, paid respect at his feet, and left.

<lzh>佛從迦維羅衛與大比丘眾千二百五十人俱，遊行人間。瞿曇彌與五百釋女自共剃頭，著袈裟衣，啼泣隨後，恒於世尊宿處而宿。</lzh>
From Kapilavatthu, the Buddha went wandering among the people together with a large bhikkhu sangha of 1,250 people. Gotamī and the 500 Sakyan women shaved their heads, put on monastic robes, and followed behind weeping. They always stayed overnight in the places where the World-honored One stayed overnight.

<lzh>佛漸遊行到舍衛城，住於祇洹，瞿曇彌及五百釋女泣涕在門。阿難晨出見其如此，即問其故，答言：「大德！世尊不聽女人出家受具足戒，我等是以自悲悼耳！願為啟白，令得從志！」阿難即還，頭面禮足，具以白佛。佛止阿難亦如上說。阿難復白佛言：「佛生少日，母便命終。瞿曇彌乳養世尊，至于長大，有此大恩如何不報？」佛言：「我於瞿曇彌亦有大恩，其依我故，識佛法僧，而生敬信。若人依善知識，識佛法僧生信敬者，於彼人所，若以衣食醫藥盡壽供養，所不能報！」阿難復白佛言：「若女人出家受具足戒，能得沙門四道果不？」佛言：「能得！」阿難言：「若得四道，世尊！何為不聽出家受具足戒？」</lzh>
Wandering by stages, the Buddha reached Sāvatthī and stayed in Jeta’s grove. Gotamī and the 500 Sakyan women wept at the gate. At dawn, Ānanda saw them in this state and asked them why. They answered: “Venerable, the World-honored One doesn’t allow women to go forth and receive the full ordination. Because of this we grieve. Please speak to the Buddha for us, and let us fulfill our aspiration.” Then Ānanda returned, paid respect with his head at the Buddha’s feet, and told him everything. The Buddha stopped Ānanda also as explained above. Ānanda said the Buddha again: “A few days after the Buddha was born, his mother passed away. Gotamī breastfed the World-honored One until he had grown up. How can one not repay this great compassion?” The Buddha said: “I also have great compassion for Gotamī. Because she relies on me, she knows the Buddha, the dhamma and the sangha, and respect and faith arose. If someone, relying on a good friend, knows the Buddha, the dhamma and the sangha, and arouses faith and respect, if they support the friend their entire life with robes, food, and medicines, they can’t repay it.” Ānanda said to the Buddha again: “If women went forth and received the full ordination, would they be able to attain the four paths and fruits of renunciates?” The Buddha said: “They’d be able to attain them.” Ānanda said: “If they can attain the four paths, why does the World-honored One not allow them to go forth and receive the full ordination?” 


<h2>(MiDm02) Garudhammas</h2>

<lzh>佛言：「今聽瞿曇彌受八不可越法，便是出家得具足戒。何謂八？比丘尼半月應從比丘眾乞教誡人；比丘尼不應於無比丘處夏安居；比丘尼自恣時，應從比丘眾請三事見聞疑罪；式叉摩那學二歲戒已，應在二部僧中受具足戒；比丘尼不得罵比丘，不得於白衣家說比丘破戒、破威儀、破見；比丘尼不得舉比丘罪，而比丘得呵比丘尼；比丘尼犯麁惡罪，應在二部僧中半月行摩那埵，半月行摩那埵已，應各二十僧中求出罪；比丘尼雖受戒百歲，故應禮拜、起迎新受戒比丘。」</lzh>
The Buddha said: “I now allow Gotamī to receive eight rules not to be transgressed. Then this is her going forth and obtainment of the full ordination. Which eight? A bhikkhunī should ask the bhikkhu sangha every half-month for an instructor. A bhikkhunī shouldn’t enter the rains retreat in a place without bhikkhus. At the time of the invitation ceremony, a bhikkhunī should invite the bhikkhu sangha with regards to three things: offenses seen, heard, or suspected. A sikkhamānā who has trained in the precepts for two years should receive the full ordination in both sanghas. A bhikkhunī may not abuse a bhikkhu, and may not tell lay families that a bhikkhu has broken the precepts, has broken proper conduct, or broken right view. A bhikkhunī may not bring up a bhikkhu’s offense, but a bhikkhu may criticize a bhikkhunī. If a bhikkhunī commits a coarse, unwholesome offense, she should undergo probation<note>Mānatta.</note> for half a month in both sanghas. When she has undergone probation for half a month, she should ask for rehabilitation in both sanghas of 20 persons each. Even if a bhikkhunī has been ordained for 100 years, she should pay respect, get up, and welcome a newly ordained bhikkhu.”


<h2>(MiDm03) Mahāpajāpatī’s story (continued)</h2>

<lzh>阿難受教，即出語瞿曇彌：「汝諦聽！我說佛所教。」瞿曇彌更整衣服，遙禮佛足，長跪合掌，一心而聽，阿難具說如上，瞿曇彌言：「猶如年少男女淨潔，自喜沐浴身體，著新淨衣。有人惠與瞻婆花鬘、婆師華鬘、優鉢羅華鬘、阿提目多伽花鬘，其人歡喜，兩手捧取舉著頭上。我今頂受世尊法教，亦復如是。」復白阿難：「願更為我入白世尊云，我已頂受八法！於八法中，欲乞一願，願聽比丘尼隨大小禮比丘！如何百歲比丘尼禮新受戒比丘？」</lzh>
Ānanda received the instruction and then went and told Gotamī: “Listen carefully. I’ll tell you the Buddha’s instruction.” Gotamī then straightened her robes, paid respect at the Buddha’s feet from afar, knelt down, joined her palms, and listened single-mindedly. Ānanda fully told her the above, and Gotamī said: “Just as a young man or woman who is clean, likes bathing their body, and has put on new, clean clothes, when people give them a garland of campaka flowers, vassikā-jasmine flowers, blue lotus flowers, or atimuttaka flowers, they’d be happy, take it with both hands, lift it up, and put it on their head, so too, I now respectfully receive the World-honored One’s teaching of the rules.” She also told Ānanda: “Please enter for me and tell the World-honored One that I said, that I’ve respectfully accepted the eight rules. Among these eight, I want to make one request. May he allow that bhikkhunīs pay respect to bhikkhus according to seniority. How can a bhikkhunī of 100 years seniority pay respect to a newly ordained bhikkhu?”

<lzh>阿難復為白佛，佛告阿難：「若我聽比丘尼隨大小禮比丘者，無有是處。女人有五礙：不得作天帝釋、魔天王、梵天王、轉輪聖王、三界法王。若不聽女人出家受具足戒，佛之正法住世千歲；今聽出家，則減五百年。猶如人家多女少男，當知其家衰滅不久。」又告阿難：「若女人不於我法出家受具足戒，我般泥洹後諸優婆塞、優婆夷，當持四供，隨比丘後，白言：『大德！憐愍我故，受我供養。』若出門見，便當牽臂言：『大德於我有恩，乞暫過坐，使我獲安！』若道路相逢，皆當解髮，拂比丘足，布令蹈上。今聽出家，此事殆盡！」</lzh>
Ānanda repeated it to the Buddha, and the Buddha told Ānanda: “That I allow the bhikkhunīs to pay respect to bhikkhus according to seniority isn’t possible. Women are obstructed from five things: they can’t become Sakka, the ruler of gods, Māra, the king of gods, Brahmā, the king of gods, a wheel-turning noble king, or a dhamma king of the three realms. If I hadn’t allowed women to go forth and receive the full ordination, the Buddha’s true dhamma would’ve stayed in the world for 1,000 years. Now that I’ve allowed them to go forth, it’s been cut down to 500 years. It’s like a family with many women and few men, one would know that that family would decline, cease to exist, and not last long.” He also told Ānanda: “If women hadn’t gone forth and received the full ordination in my dhamma, after my parinibbāna the lay men and lay women would’ve taken the four offerings, followed behind a bhikkhu and said: ‘Venerable, out of compassion for me, accept these offerings.’ If they had come through their gates and seen him, they’d have pulled his arm and said: ‘Venerable, have compassion for me, please come over and sit down here for a while, and let me get some peace.’ If they had met him on the road, they all would’ve let down their hair, wiped the bhikkhu’s feet, and spread it out to let him step on it. Now that I’ve allowed the going forth, these things have almost stopped.”

<lzh>阿難聞已，悲恨流淚，白佛言：「世尊！我先不聞，不知此法，求聽女人出家受具足戒。若我先知，豈當三請？」佛告阿難：「勿復啼泣！魔蔽汝心，是故爾耳！今聽女人出家受具足戒，當應隨順我之所制，不得有違；我所不制，不得妄制！」阿難即出，具以佛教語瞿曇彌。瞿曇彌歡喜奉行，即成出家受具足戒。復白阿難：「此五百釋女，今當云何受具足戒？願更為白！」阿難即以白佛，佛言：「即聽波闍波提比丘尼為作和尚，在比丘十眾中，白四羯磨受具足戒。聽一時羯磨三人，不得至四。」</lzh>
When Ānanda heard this, he felt sadness and regret, and tears streamed down. He told the Buddha: “World-honored One, I earlier hadn’t heard and didn’t know about this matter, when I asked you to allow women to go forth and receive the full ordination. If I had known this earlier, how could I’ve made three requests?” The Buddha told Ānanda: “Don’t weep anymore. Māra clouded your mind, therefore you did this. Now that I’ve allowed women to go forth and receive the full ordination, one should follow what I’ve laid down, one may not depart from it. What I haven’t laid down, one may not wrongly lay down.” Then Ānanda went out, and fully told Gotamī about the Buddha’s instruction. Gotamī was happy and received it respectfully. Then her going forth and reception of the full ordination were completed. She told Ānanda again: “Now how should these 500 Sakyan women receive the full ordination? Please ask for me again.” Ānanda then asked the Buddha, and the Buddha said: “Then I allow that they receive the full ordination with Pajāpatī bhikkhunī as preceptor, in a sangha of 10 bhikkhus, in a formal act with a motion as fourth. I allow to announce three persons at one time. One may not include four.”

<lzh>既受戒已，摩訶波闍波提比丘尼，與五百比丘尼俱到佛所，頭面禮足，白佛言：「世尊！我等云何著衣？」佛言：「如比丘法。」又白：「云何食？」答言：「聽乞食。」又白：「云何布薩？」答言：「聽別布薩，半月從比丘僧乞教誡人。」又白：「云何結安居？」答言：「聽於屋下結三月安居。」又白：「云何自恣？」答言：「聽別自恣。往比丘僧中，請見聞疑罪。」又白：「云何受迦絺那衣？」答言：「聽白二羯磨四月日受。」又白：「云何畜皮革？」答言：「聽作行來革屣。」又白：「云何滅諍？」佛言：「聽以七滅諍法，滅四事諍。」</lzh>
(MiDm04) When they had received the ordination, Mahāpajāpatī bhikkhunī went to the Buddha together with the 500 bhikkhunīs, paid respect with her head at his feet, and told the Buddha: “World-honored One, how should we wear the robes?” The Buddha said: “In the same way as the bhikkhus.” She asked again: “How should we eat?” He answered: “I allow to go on almsround.” She asked again: “How should we do the uposatha?” He answered: “I allow a separate uposatha, and to ask the bhikkhu sangha for an instructor every half-month.” She asked again: “How should we settle down for the rains retreat?” He answered: “I allow to settle down under a roof for the three months of the rains retreat.” She asked again: “How should we do the invitation ceremony?” He answered: “I allow a separate invitation ceremony, and to go to the bhikkhu sangha to invite with regards to seen, heard, or suspected offenses.” She asked again: “How should we receive the kaṭhina robe?” He answered: “I allow to receive it in a formal act with a motion as second on the days of the fourth month.” She asked again: “How should we keep leather?” He answered: “I allow to make leather sandals for walking around.” She asked again: “How should we settle disputes?” The Buddha said: “I allow to settle the four matters of dispute with the seven rules for settling disputes.”

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼不先授弟子二歲戒，便授大戒，愚癡無知，不能學戒。以是白佛，佛言：「不應爾，犯者突吉羅！應如是：先授二歲不得殺生、二歲不得偷盜、二歲不得婬、二歲不得妄語、二歲不得飲酒、二歲不得非時食。」</lzh>
(MiDm05) At that time, the bhikkhunīs didn’t give their students the precepts for two years first, and immediately gave the full ordination. They were ignorant and without knowledge, and not able to train in the precepts. They told the Buddha of this. The Buddha said: “You shouldn’t do this. You commit a dukkaṭa. You should do it as follows: First, you give: ‘for two years you may not kill beings, for two years you may not steal, for two years you may not engage in sex, for two years you may not lie, for two years you may not drink alcohol, and for two years you may not eat at the wrong time.’”

<lzh>時有一比丘尼媒嫁，犯僧伽婆尸沙。不知云何？以是白佛，佛以是事集二部僧，告諸比丘：「聽二部僧白四羯磨與彼比丘尼半月摩那埵。」</lzh>
(MiDm06) Then there was one bhikkhunī who engaged in matchmaking and committed a saṅghādisesa. She didn’t know what to do. They told the Buddha of this. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter and told the bhikkhus: “I allow that both sanghas give this bhikkhunī probation for half a month in a formal act with a motion as fourth. 

<lzh>彼比丘尼應到僧中，偏袒右肩，脫革屣，禮二部僧足，白言：「大德僧聽！我某甲比丘尼媒嫁，犯僧伽婆尸沙罪，今從僧乞半月摩那埵。願僧與我半月摩那埵！」如是三乞。</lzh>
This bhikkhunī should go into the midst of the sangha, uncover her right shoulder, take off her leather sandals, pay respect at both sanghas’ feet, and inform them: ‘Venerables, may the sangha listen. I, bhikkhunī So-and-so, have engaged in matchmaking and committed a saṅghādisesa offense. I now ask the sangha for probation for half a month. May the sangha give me propation for half a month.’ She asks like this three times.

<lzh>應一比丘唱言：「大德僧聽！此某甲比丘尼媒嫁，犯僧伽婆尸沙罪，從僧乞半月摩那埵。僧今與半月摩那埵。若僧時到僧忍聽。白如是。」</lzh>
One bhikkhu should announce: ‘Venerables, may the sangha listen. This bhikkhunī So-and-so has engaged in matchmaking and committed a saṅghādisesa offense. She asks the sangha for probation for half a month. The sangha now gives probation for half a month. If the right time has come for the sangha, may the sangha approve it. This is the motion.’ 

<lzh>「大德僧聽！此某甲比丘尼媒嫁，犯僧伽婆尸沙罪，從僧乞半月摩那埵。僧今與半月摩那埵。誰諸長老忍，默然；不忍者，說。」如是三說。</lzh>
‘Venerables, may the sangha listen. This bhikkhunī So-and-so has engaged in matchmaking and committed a saṅghādisesa offense. She asks the sangha for probation for half a month. The sangha now gives probation for half a month. Those of the venerables who accept it should remain silent. Those who don’t accept it should speak.’ He speaks like this three times.

<lzh>「僧已與某甲比丘尼半月摩那埵竟；僧忍，默然故。是事如是持。」</lzh>
‘The sangha has given bhikkhunī So-and-so probation for half a month. The sangha accepts this, therefore you’re silent. This matter is remembered thus.’ 

<lzh>僧既與行摩那埵，應晨起掃灑比丘尼住處諸房，泥治壁地，應有水處皆取令滿，諸有可作皆應作之；若客比丘尼來、比丘尼去，亦皆應白。又應將一比丘尼為伴至比丘住處，若有可作，皆應如上作之；若客比丘來、若比丘去，亦皆應白；日欲暮，還比丘尼住處。如是半月行已，於二部僧各二十人中，求出罪羯磨，如比丘法。</lzh>
When the sangha has allowed her to undertake probation, she should get up at dawn, sweep and mop the buildings of the bhikkhunī residence, apply mud to the walls and floors, fetch water and completely fill up all the places where there should be water, she should do all the chores, and if guest bhikkhunīs come, or if bhikkhunīs leave, she should speak with them all. She should also go to the bhikkhu residence with one bhikkhunī as companion, and if there are chores, she should do them all as above. If guest bhikkhus come, or if bhikkhus leave, she should speak with them all. When the day is about to end, she should return to the bhikkhunī residence. When she has practised like this for half a month, she should request the formal act of rehabilitation in both sanghas with 20 persons each, as in the bhikkhu rules.”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼不禮比丘，無人教誡，愚癡無知，不能學戒。以是白佛，佛呵責言：「我先說八不可越法，百歲比丘尼禮新受戒比丘。云何於今而不禮敬？」呵已，告諸比丘：「從今聽諸比丘隨次禮上座；諸比丘尼禮一切比丘，亦隨次自相禮；式叉摩那禮一切比丘、比丘尼，亦隨次自相禮；沙彌亦如是；沙彌尼禮一切比丘、比丘尼、式叉摩那、沙彌，亦隨次自相禮。」</lzh>
(MiDm07) Then the bhikkhunīs didn’t pay respect to the bhikkhus. Nobody instructed them, and they were ignorant and without knowledge, and not able to train in the precepts. They told the Buddha of this. The Buddha criticized them: “I’ve earlier taught the eight rules not to be transgressed: A bhikkhunī who has been ordained for 100 years pays respect to a newly ordained bhikkhu. Why is it that they now don’t pay respect?” Having criticized them, he told the bhikkhus: “From now on, I allow bhikkhus to pay respect to seniors according to seniority. Bhikkhunīs pay respect to all bhikkhus, and among themselves according to seniority. Sikkhamānās pay respect to all bhikkhus, and bhikkhunīs, and among themselves according to seniority. Sāmaṇeras also do the same. Sāmaṇerīs pay respect to all bhikkhus, bhikkhunīs, sikkhamānās, and sāmaṇeras, and among themselves according to seniority.”

<lzh>有比丘尼在高處禮下處比丘、或在比丘後、或於傍邊禮、或手捉足、或膝著地禮。以是白佛，佛言：「皆不應爾！聽比丘尼去比丘不近不遠，合掌低頭，作是言：『和南。』」</lzh>
(MiDm08) There were bhikkhunīs who were in a high place and paid respect to bhikkhus in a low place, or behind the bhikkhus, or at the side, or by holding (the bhikkhu’s) feet with their hands, or by placing their knees on the ground. They told the Buddha of this. The Buddha said: “You shouldn’t do all this. I allow a bhikkhunī to go not to close to and not too far from a bhikkhu, join her palms, bow her head, and say: ‘I venerate you.<note>vandāmi.</note>’”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼髮長，佛言：「應求女人剃之。若無女人，聽使男子；但不得獨、不得令捉，有餘比丘尼伴為捉，然後使剃。」</lzh>
(MiDm09) Then the bhikkhunīs’ hair was long. The Buddha said: “You should ask a woman to shave it. If there’s no woman, I allow to have a man do it. But you may not be alone, and may not have him hold you. There should be another bhikkhunī companion to hold you, and then you have him shave.”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼，從比丘尼受經，誦不能得。復有一比丘尼，從比丘尼受一波羅提木叉，多日不能得。後從比丘受即得。以是白佛，佛言：「聽比丘尼從比丘受經。若經中有麁惡語，聽書授；若不知書，聽隔障授；若無障隔，聽相背授。」</lzh>
(MiDm10) Then the bhikkhunīs received the suttas from bhikkhunīs and couldn’t remember the recitation. There was also a bhikkhunī who received the pātimokkha from bhikkhunīs and couldn’t remember it for many days. Later they received them from bhikkhus and remembered them. They told the Buddha of this. The Buddha said: “I allow that the bhikkhunīs receive the suttas from bhikkhus. If there’s coarse unwholesome language in the suttas, I allow to give it in writing. If they don’t know how to write, I allow to give it separated by a screen. If there’s no screen to separate them, I allow them to turn their backs to each other and give it.”

<lzh>有諸比丘尼與比丘共布薩，見比丘犯罪，便欲舉之。以是白佛，佛言：「比丘尼不得共比丘布薩。應半月請一比丘，令從比丘僧乞教誡人。」</lzh>
(MiDm11) There were bhikkhunīs who did the uposatha together with bhikkhus. When they saw that a bhikkhu had committed an offense, they wanted to bring it up. They told the Buddha of this. The Buddha said: “Bhikkhunīs may not do the uposatha together with bhikkhus. They should ask one bhikkhu every half-month, and have him ask the bhikkhu sangha for an instructor.”

<lzh>諸比丘不肯為乞，佛言：「聽比丘尼為作供養，鉢囊、漉水囊、腰繩、香油、前食、後食。」</lzh>
(MiDm12) The bhikkhus didn’t agree to ask. The Buddha said: “I allow the bhikkhunīs to make offerings to them: a bowl bag, a water filter, a waistband, incense, breakfast, or lunch.”

<lzh>或未布薩為白、或已布薩乃白，佛言：「不應爾！應於唱說不來諸比丘欲清淨時，從坐起，在僧前立，白言：『大德僧聽！某精舍和合比丘尼僧，頂禮和合比丘僧足，乞教誡人。』」</lzh>
(MiDm13) Some asked when it wasn’t uposatha yet, and some asked when the uposatha was already over. The Buddha said: “You shouldn’t do this. When they announce the consent and purity of the bhikkhus who haven’t come, you should rise from your seat, stand in front of the sangha, and say: ‘Venerables, may the sangha listen. The bhikkhunī sangha of the monastery So-and-so in harmony pays homage at the feet of the bhikkhu sangha in harmony, and asks for an instructor.’

<lzh>若僧先已差教誡人，上座應答：「從某甲比丘受。」若僧無所差人，有能說法者，應答：「往某甲比丘邊受。」若復無者，應答：「此無差教誡人，又無能說法者。汝等莫放逸！」</lzh>
If the sangha has already chosen an instructor, the most senior monk should answer: ‘Receive it from bhikkhu So-and-so.’ If the sangha hasn’t chosen anyone yet, but they’ve someone who is able to teach dhamma, he should answer: ‘Go to bhikkhu So-and-so and receive it.’ If there’s nobody, he should answer: ‘Here there’s no chosen instructor, and there’s also nobody who is able to teach dhamma. Don’t be negligent.’<note>It seems that the senior monk directly addresses the bhikkhunīs here. But actually only their messenger bhikkhu is present.</note>

<lzh>諸比丘尼明日應來問：「乞教誡比丘竟，為白僧不？」此比丘應傳上座語，語之。</lzh>
The bhikkhunīs should come the next day and ask: ‘Have you asked for an instructing bhikkhu, and spoken with the sangha?’ The bhikkhu should pass on the senior bhikkhu’s words to them.”

<lzh>有諸比丘尼，共比丘自恣。比丘尼欲往阿練若處就比丘自恣，道中遇賊、水、火，有命難、梵行難、衣鉢難；又更相待，稽留自恣。以是白佛，佛言：「比丘尼不得共比丘自恣，應別自恣，從比丘僧請見聞疑罪。」</lzh>
(MiDm14) There were bhikkhunīs who did the invitation ceremony together with bhikkhus. The bhikkhunīs wanted to go to the wilderness to invite the bhikkhus. On the way, they encountered criminals, water, and fire, and their lives were in danger, their celibacy was in danger, and their robes and bowls were in danger. They also waited for each other and delayed the invitation ceremony. They told the Buddha of this. The Buddha said: “Bhikkhunīs may not do the invitation ceremony together with bhikkhus. They should do the invitation ceremony separately, and invite the bhikkhu sangha with regards to seen, heard, or suspected offenses.”

<lzh>時聚落中無比丘，諸比丘尼往阿練若處請見聞疑罪，或道遠不達、或彼比丘不為和合，遂不得請。以是白佛，佛言：「聽阿練若處比丘為比丘尼來聚落自恣、為其和合。諸比丘尼應先集眾自恣，然後差比丘尼，就比丘僧請見聞疑罪。」</lzh>
(MiDm15) Then there were no bhikkhus in the village, and the bhikkhunīs went into the wilderness to invite with regards to seen, heard, or suspected offenses. For some, the distance was too far and they didn’t arrive, and sometimes those bhikkhus weren’t in harmony. Thereupon, they weren’t able to invite them. They told the Buddha of this. The Buddha said: “I allow that bhikkhus living in the wilderness come to the village for the bhikkhunīs to do the invitation ceremony, and to be in harmony for them. The bhikkhunīs should first gather their sangha and do the invitation ceremony, and later choose a bhikkhunī to invite the bhikkhu sangha with regards to seen, heard, or suspected offenses.

<lzh>至已，偏袒右肩，脫革屣，遙禮僧足。然後入僧中，合掌曲身，白言：「某精舍和合，比丘尼僧頂禮和合比丘僧足。我等比丘尼僧和合，請大德僧自恣說見聞疑罪。」如是三請。</lzh>
When they’ve arrived, she uncovers her right shoulder, takes off her leather sandals, and pays respect at the sangha’s feet from afar. Then she enters into the midst of the sangha, joins her palms, bends her body, and tells them: ‘The bhikkhunī sangha of the monastery So-and-so in harmony pays homage at the feet of the bhikkhu sangha in harmony. We, the bhikkhunī sangha in harmony, invite the venerable sangha to speak about seen, heard, or suspected offenses.’ She invites like this three times.”

<lzh>時諸比丘語波闍波提比丘尼言：「汝無和尚，不成出家受具足戒。」彼便生疑，以是白佛，佛言：「汝受八不可越法時，已是出家受具足戒。」</lzh>
(MiDm16) Then the bhikkhus said to Pajāpatī bhikkhunī: “You don’t have a preceptor, your going forth and full ordination aren’t valid.” Doubt then arose in her. They told the Buddha of this. The Buddha said: “When you accepted the eight rules not to be transgressed, it was your going forth and full ordination.”

<lzh>有比丘尼誘弄比丘言：「我是族姓，禮儀備舉，女工具足。」意欲給侍彼比丘，便生染著心，不復樂道，遂致反俗。諸比丘以是白佛。佛言：「比丘尼不應誘弄比丘，犯者突吉羅！」</lzh>
(MiDm17) There was a bhikkhunī who messed around with a bhikkhu and said: “I’m from a good clan, have good manners, and am perfect in women’s chores,” and wanted to serve that bhikkhu. Then defiled attachment arose in his mind. He was no longer happy on the path and thereupon returned to lay life. The bhikkhus told the Buddha of this. The Buddha said: “A bhikkhunī shouldn’t mess around with a bhikkhu. You commit a dukkaṭa.”

<lzh>有諸比丘尼來比丘住處，或露胸脇、或露髀膞，諸比丘見生染著心，不復樂道，遂致反俗。諸比丘以是白佛，佛言：「不應爾！從今不聽比丘尼入比丘住處！」</lzh>
(MiDm18) There were bhikkhunīs who came to the bhikkhu residence. Some exposed their chests and flanks, some exposed their thighs and knees. When the bhikkhus saw it, defiled attachment arose in their minds. They were no longer happy on the path and thereupon, they returned to lay life. The bhikkhus told the Buddha of this. The Buddha said: “You shouldn’t do this. From now on, I don’t allow bhikkhunīs to enter a bhikkhu residence.”

<lzh>既不得入，便無教誡，愚闇無知，不能學戒。以是白佛，佛言：「若如法比丘尼聽入，亦應喚來。」</lzh>
(MiDm19) Then they weren’t allowed to enter, and they had no instruction. They were ignorant and without knowledge, and not able to train in the precepts. They told the Buddha of this. The Buddha said: “If it accords with dhamma, a bhikkhunī is allowed to enter. She should call out and come.”

<lzh>既喚不來，佛言：「喚不來，突吉羅！」</lzh>
(MiDm20) Then they called out but didn’t come. The Buddha said: “If you call out and don’t come, it’s a dukkaṭa.”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼不共比丘語，無人教誡，愚闇無知，不能學戒。諸比丘尼以是白佛，佛言：「不應爾，犯者突吉羅！」</lzh>
(MiDm21) Then the bhikkhunīs didn’t speak with the bhikkhus. Nobody instructed them. They were ignorant and without knowledge, and not able to train in the precepts. The bhikkhunīs told the Buddha of this. The Buddha said: “You shouldn’t do this. You commit a dukkaṭa.” 

<lzh>時優蹉比丘尼數數犯罪，比丘尼僧與作不見罪羯磨，便啼哭言：「我愚癡，僧與我作不見罪羯磨，我或於中更犯麁罪！願僧為我解此羯磨！」諸比丘尼以是白佛，佛言：「不應為解羯磨，應白二羯磨差一比丘尼伴之，共語、共同行止。」</lzh>
(MiDm22) Then Youcuo bhikkhunī often committed offenses. The bhikkhunī sangha carried out a formal act for not seeing offenses, and then she cried and said: “I’m ignorant and the sangha has carried out a formal act for not seeing offenses against me. If I’m in this, I might even commit a coarse offense. May the sangha release me from this formal act.” The bhikkhunīs told the Buddha of this. The Buddha said: “You shouldn’t release her from the formal act. You should choose one bhikkhunī companion in a formal act with a motion as second, to talk with her and spend time with her.

<lzh>一比丘尼唱言：「阿姨僧聽！今差某甲比丘尼，伴優蹉比丘尼共語、共同行止。若僧時到僧忍聽。白如是。」</lzh>
One bhikkhunī should announce: ‘Venerables, may the sangha listen. Now we choose bhikkhunī So-and-so as companion for Youcuo bhikkhunī, to talk with her and spend time with her. If the right time has come for the sangha, may the sangha approve it. This is the motion.’

<lzh>「阿姨僧聽！今差某甲比丘尼，伴優蹉比丘尼共語、共同行止。誰諸阿姨忍，默然；不忍者，說。僧已差某甲比丘尼，伴優蹉比丘尼竟；僧忍，默然故。是事如是持。」</lzh>
‘Venerables, may the sangha listen. Now we choose bhikkhunī So-and-so as companion for Youcuo bhikkhunī, to talk with her and spend time with her. Those of the venerables who accept it should remain silent. Those who don’t accept it should speak. The sangha has chosen bhikkhunī So-and-so as companion for Youcuo bhikkhunī. The sangha accepts this, therefore you’re silent. This matter is remembered thus.’”

<lzh>有比丘尼月水出，污脚及衣；入聚落乞食，諸白衣見譏呵。佛言：「若比丘尼月水出時，不聽入聚落乞食。聽聚糧，亦聽弟子并為乞；若無弟子，聽著月水衣乞食。」</lzh>
(MiDm23) There was a bhikkhunī who menstruated and soiled her feet and robes. When she entered the village on almsround, the lay people saw it and criticized her. The Buddha said: “When a bhikkhunī is menstruating, she shouldn’t enter the village on almsround. I allow to prepare provisions, and I also allow that her students ask (for food) for her. If she has no students, I allow that she wear a menstrual robe on almsround.”

<lzh>有諸貴姓女出家不著覆肩衣，諸白衣見其肩臂，共調弄之，皆懷慚恥。諸比丘尼以是白佛，佛言：「聽著覆肩衣！」</lzh>
(MiDm24) There were women from noble clans who went forth and didn’t wear shoulder-covering robes. When the lay people saw their arms, they fooled around, and everyone felt ashamed. The bhikkhunīs told the Buddha of this. The Buddha said: “I allow to wear a shoulder-covering robe.”


<h2>(MiDm25) Ordination Procedure</h2>

<lzh>時諸比丘尼弟子學二歲戒不合意，便與受具足戒。佛言：「不應爾，犯者突吉羅！從今聽合和尚、阿闍梨意，乃為集十眾。」</lzh>
Then the bhikkhunīs gave the full ordination to students who had trained in the precepts for two years, but who hadn’t been agreed upon. The Buddha said: “You shouldn’t do this. You commit a dukkaṭa. From now on, I allow that the precepter and the teachers agree upon her, and then gather a group of 10.

<lzh>至受戒處，將欲受戒人著眼見，耳不聞處，和尚應為求羯磨師及教誡師。得已，羯磨師應羯磨教誡師，令出外教，唱言：「阿姨僧聽！某甲求某甲受具足戒，某甲作教誡師。若僧時到僧忍聽。白如是。」</lzh>
They go to the place for the ordination ceremony, and take the candidate to a place within sight and out of earshot. The preceptor should ask for a master of ceremony and an instructor. Having found them, the master of ceremony should do a formal act for the instructor, to let her go outside and instruct (the candidate). She should announce: ‘Venerables, may the sangha listen. So-and-so asks for the full ordination from So-and-so. So-and-so will act as instructor. If the right time has come for the sangha, may the sangha approve it. This is the motion.’

<lzh>彼教誡師應行初法，先問和尚：「此欲受具足戒人，學二歲戒日滿不？衣鉢具不？」若言不具，應語令具；若言具，復應問：「為是己有？為是借？」若言借，應語借主捨與；然後乃往欲受戒人所，語言：「汝莫恐怖，須臾當著汝於高勝處！」</lzh>
This instructor should follow the procedure from the beginning, and first ask the preceptor: ‘Has this candidate trained in the training precepts for the whole period of two years? Are her robes and bowl complete?’ If she says that they’re not complete, the other should tell her to complete them. If she says that they’re complete, the other should ask again: ‘Are they her own? Are they borrowed?’ If she says that they’re borrowed, the other should tell the owner to relinquish them and give them to her. Then she goes to the candidate and says: ‘Don’t be afraid, in a moment we’ll admit you to a lofty place.’

<lzh>若先不諳悉，應小披衣觀看，無遮受戒法不？問言：「何者是汝僧伽梨、憂多羅僧、安陀會、覆肩衣、水浴衣？」彼若不識，應語令識。次與受衣鉢，如比丘中說。</lzh>
If she’s not fully sure at first, she should unfold the robes a little and examine them, whether there are no obstructions to receiving the ordination. She should ask: ‘Which one is your saṅghāṭī, your upper robe, your lower robe, your shoulder-covering robe, and your bathing robe?’ If (the candidate) doesn’t know, she should tell her to let her know. Next, she should give her the robes and bowl, as explained for the bhikkhus.

<lzh>復應語言：「汝某甲聽！今是實語時，我今問汝，若有當言有，若無當言無。女人有如是病：癩病、白癩病、乾痟病、癲狂病、癰疽、漏病、脂出病，如是等重病，汝有不？不負債不？非他婦不？夫主聽不？不屬官不？非婢不？是人不？是女人不？女根具足不？汝非黃門不？非石女不？非二道合不？月水出不？不常出不？學二歲戒日滿不？已求和尚未？父母聽不？欲受具足戒不？如我今問，後僧中亦當如是問汝，汝亦當如是答彼。」</lzh>
She should say again: ‘So-and-so, listen. Now is a time for speaking the truth. I’ll now ask you. If something is so, you should say yes. If not, you should say no. Women have such diseases: Leprosy, mild leprosy, tuberculosis, epilepsy, abscesses, discharge, or a disease that produces grease. Do you have such kinds of serious diseases? You’re not in debt? You’re not married? Has your husband allowed it? You’re not a bondservant of an official? You’re not a slave? Are you a human being? Are you a woman? Are your female organs complete? Are you not a eunuch? Are you not a barren woman? Are your anus and vagina not joined? Do you menstruate? Do you not menstruate permanently? Have you trained in the training precepts for the whole period of two years? Have you already requested a preceptor? Have your parents allowed it? Do you want to receive the full ordination? As I’ve asked now, they’ll also ask you later in the sangha. You should also answer like this there.’

<lzh>教誡師應還僧中立，白言：「我已問竟！」</lzh>
The instructor should return, stand in the midst of the sangha, and tell them: ‘I’ve finished asking her.’

<lzh>羯磨師應白僧言：「阿姨僧聽！某甲求某甲受具足戒，某甲已問竟，今聽將來。若僧時到僧忍聽。白如是。」</lzh>
The master of ceremony should inform the sangha: “Venerables, may the sangha listen. So-and-so asks for the full ordination from So-and-so. So-and-so has finished asking her. Now we allow to take her here. If the right time has come for the sangha, may the sangha approve it. This is the motion.’

<lzh>教師應往將來，教禮僧足。禮已，將至羯磨師前，教䠒跪合掌向羯磨師，從僧乞受具足戒。教言：「我某甲，求某甲和尚受具足戒；今從僧乞受具足戒，和尚某甲。僧濟拔我，憐愍故！」如是三乞。</lzh>
The instructor should go and take her there, and teach her to pay respect at the sangha’s feet. Having paid resect, she should take her in front of the master of ceremony, teach her to kneel down, join her palms towards the master of ceremony, and ask the sangha for the full ordination. She should teach her to say: ‘I, So-and-so, ask my preceptor So-and-so for the full ordination. I now ask the sangha for the full ordination, with my preceptor So-and-so. May the sangha save me out of compassion.’ She asks like this three times.

<lzh>教師然後還復坐，羯磨師應白僧：「阿姨僧聽！此某甲，求某甲受具足戒；彼從僧乞受具足戒，和尚某甲。我今於僧中問諸難事。若僧時到僧忍聽。白如是。」</lzh>
Afterwards the instructor returns to her seat, and the master of ceremony should tell the sangha: ‘Venerables, may the sangha listen. This So-and-so asks for the full ordination from So-and-so. She has asked the sangha for the full ordination, with her preceptor So-and-so. I’ll now ask her in the midst of the sangha about the difficulties. If the right time has come for the sangha, may the sangha approve it. This is the motion.’

<lzh>應語言：「汝聽！今是實語時，我今問汝，若有便言有，若無便言無。」乃至「欲受戒不？」皆如上問。</lzh>
She should say: ‘Listen. Now is a time for speaking the truth. I’ll now ask you. If something is so, you should say yes. If not, you should say no. … Do you want to receive the ordination?’ All to be asked as above.

<lzh>如上問已，羯磨師復應唱言：「阿姨僧聽！此某甲，求某甲受具足戒；彼從僧乞受具足戒，自說無諸難事、學二歲戒滿、五衣鉢具、已求和尚、父母已聽，欲受具足戒。僧今與某甲受具足戒，和尚某甲。若僧時到僧忍聽。白如是。」</lzh>
Having asked as above, the master of ceremony should again announce: ‘Venerables, may the sangha listen. This So-and-so asks for the full ordination from So-and-so. She has asked the sangha for the full ordination. She says herself that there are no difficulties, has finished training in the precepts for two years, her five robes and bowl are complete, she has requested a preceptor, her parents have allowed it, and she wants to receive the full ordination. The sangha now gives So-and-so the full ordination, with her preceptor So-and-so. If the right time has come for the sangha, may the sangha approve it. This is the motion.’

<lzh>「阿姨僧聽！某甲，求某甲受具足戒。」乃至「和尚某甲。誰諸阿姨忍，默然；不忍者，說。」如是第二、第三說。</lzh>
‘Venerables, may the sangha listen. So-and-so asks for the full ordination from So-and-so. … with her preceptor So-and-so. Those of the venerables who accept it should remain silent. Those who don’t accept it should speak.’ To be recited like this a second and third time.

<lzh>「僧已與某甲受具足戒，和尚某甲竟；僧忍，默然故。是事如是持。」</lzh>
‘The sangha has given So-and-so the full ordination with her preceptor So-and-so. The sangha accepts this, therefore you’re silent. This matter is remembered thus.’

<lzh>彼和尚、阿闍梨，復應集十比丘尼僧，將受戒人往比丘僧中。在比丘羯磨師前小遠，兩膝著地，乞受具足戒。羯磨師應教言：「我某甲，求某甲和尚受具足戒，已於一眾中受具足戒竟，清淨無諸難事、已學二歲戒滿、衣鉢具足、已求和尚、父母已聽、不犯麁惡罪，欲受具足戒；今從僧乞受具足戒，和尚某甲。僧濟拔我，憐愍故！」如是三乞。</lzh>
Her preceptor and teachers should gather a sangha of 10 bhikkhunīs again, and take the candidate to the bhikkhu sangha. At a little distance from the bhikkhus’ master of ceremony, she should place both knees on the ground, and ask for the full ordination. The master of ceremony should teach her to say: ‘I, So-and-so, have asked my preceptor So-and-so for the full ordination, have already received the full ordination in one sangha, am pure and without difficulties, have finished training in the precepts for two years, my robes and bowl are complete, I’ve requested a preceptor, my parents have allowed it, I haven’t committed a coarse, unwholesome offense, and want to receive the full ordination. I now ask the sangha for the full ordination, with my preceptor So-and-so. May the sangha save me out of compassion.’ She asks like this three times.

<lzh>三乞已，羯磨師應白：「大德僧聽！此某甲，求某甲受具足戒，已於一眾中受具足戒竟，清淨無諸難事、已學二歲戒滿、先所應作已作、衣鉢具足、已求和尚、父母已聽、不犯麁惡罪，欲受具足戒；今從僧乞受具足戒，和尚某甲。僧今與某甲受具足戒，和尚某甲。若僧時到僧忍聽。白如是。」</lzh>
After three requests, the master of ceremony should say: ‘Venerables, may the sangha listen. This So-and-so asks for the full ordination from So-and-so. She has already received the full ordination in one sangha, is pure and without difficulties, has finished training in the precepts for two years, what should have been done first has been done, her robes and bowl are complete, she has requested a preceptor, her parents have allowed it, she hasn’t committed a coarse, unwholesome offense, and she wants to receive the full ordination. She now asks the sangha for the full ordination, with her preceptor So-and-so. The sangha now gives So-and-so the full ordination, with her preceptor So-and-so. If the right time has come for the sangha, may the sangha approve it. This is the motion.’

<lzh>「大德僧聽！此某甲，求某甲受具足戒。」乃至「僧今與某甲受具足戒，和尚某甲。誰諸長老忍，默然；不忍者，說。」如是第二、第三說。</lzh>
‘Venerables, may the sangha listen. This So-and-so asks for the full ordination from So-and-so. … The sangha now gives So-and-so the full ordination, with her preceptor So-and-so. Those of the venerables who accept it should remain silent. Those who don’t accept it should speak.’ To be recited like this a second and third time.

<lzh>「僧已與某甲受具足戒，和尚某甲竟；僧忍，默然故。是事如是持。」</lzh>
‘The sangha has given So-and-so the full ordination with her preceptor So-and-so. The sangha accepts this, therefore you’re silent. This matter is remembered thus.’

<lzh>復應語言：「某甲聽！如來、應供、等正覺說八波羅夷法，若比丘尼犯此一一法，非比丘尼、非釋種女。一切不得婬，乃至以染著心看他男子。若比丘尼，行婬法乃至畜生，非比丘尼、非釋種女。是中盡形壽不應犯！」若能持，當言：「能！」</lzh>
They should say again: ‘So-and-so, listen. The Tathāgata, worthy of offerings and fully awakened, has spoken eight pārājika rules. If a bhikkhunī breaks any one of these rules, she’s not a bhikkhunī, not a Sakyan daughter. You may not be sexually active at all, not even look at a man with a mind of defiled attachment. If a bhikkhunī engages in sexual intercourse, even with an animal, she’s not a bhikkhunī, not a Sakyan daughter. You shouldn’t commit this for your whole life. If you can keep it, you should say: “I can.”

<lzh>「一切不得偷盜，乃至草葉。若比丘尼，若聚落、若空地，他所守護物，盜五錢、若過五錢，非比丘尼、非釋種女。是中盡形壽不得犯！」若能持，當言：「能！」</lzh>
You may not steal at all, not even grass and leaves. If a bhikkhunī in a village or an empty place takes an item that others protect and that (is worth) five coins or more than five coins, she’s not a bhikkhunī, not a Sakyan daughter. You may not commit this for your whole life. If you can keep it, you should say: “I can.”

<lzh>「一切不得殺生，乃至蟻子。若比丘尼，若人、若似人，自手斷命、持刀授與、教人殺、教死、讚死，非比丘尼、非釋種女。是中盡形壽不應犯！」若能持，當言：「能！」</lzh>
You may not kill beings at all, not even ants. If a bhikkhunī kills a human being or a human-like being, either herself or by giving them a knife, or by instructing people to kill, or by teaching and praising death, she’s not a bhikkhunī, not a Sakyan daughter. You shouldn’t commit this for your whole life. If you can keep it, you should say: “I can.”

<lzh>「一切不得妄語，乃至戲笑。若比丘尼，自無過人法，若言有諸禪解脫、三昧、正受、若道、若果，非比丘尼、非釋種女。是中盡形壽不應犯！」若能持，當言：「能！」</lzh>
You may not lie at all, not even as a joke. If a bhikkhunī, who doesn’t have a superhuman state herself, says that she has jhānas, liberations, samādhi, mental unity, paths, or fruits, she’s not a bhikkhunī, not a Sakyan daughter. You shouldn’t commit this for your whole life. If you can keep it, you should say: “I can.”

<lzh>「一切不得親近男子。若比丘尼，欲盛變心摩觸男子身，髮已下，膝已上；若男子作如此摩觸，亦不得受，若按、若掐、若舉、若下、若捉、若牽，非比丘尼、非釋種女。是中盡形壽不應犯！」若能持，當言：「能！」</lzh>
You may not be close to a man. If a bhikkhunī, in a mindstate altered by abundant desire, rubs and touches a man’s body, below the hair, above the knees, or if the man does this rubbing and touching, she may not let him do it, whether he presses her, pinches her, lifts her up, sets her down, holds her, or pulls her; she’s not a bhikkhunī, not a Sakyan daughter. You shouldn’t commit this for your whole life. If you can keep it, you should say: “I can.”

<lzh>「一切不得與男子共住、共語。若比丘尼，欲盛變心受男子，若捉手、若捉衣、若期行、若獨共行、若獨共住、若獨共語、若獨共坐、若以身相近，具是八事，非比丘尼、非釋種女。是中盡形壽不應犯！」若能持，當言：「能！」</lzh>
You may not stand and talk with a man at all. If a bhikkhunī, in a mindstate altered by abundant desire, lets a man hold her hand, hold her robe, goes to an appointment, walks with him alone, stands with him alone, talks with him alone, sits with him alone, and brings her body close to him, fulfilling these eight things, she’s not a bhikkhunī, not a Sakyan daughter. You shouldn’t commit this for your whole life. If you can keep it, you should say: “I can.”

<lzh>「一切不得隨順非法比丘語。若比丘尼，知和合比丘僧，如法舉比丘；而隨順此比丘。諸比丘尼語言：『姊妹！此比丘，為和合比丘僧如法舉。汝莫隨順！』如是諫，堅持不捨；應第二、第三諫。第二、第三諫，捨是事善；不捨者，非比丘尼、非釋種女。是中盡形壽不應犯！」若能持當言：「能！」</lzh>
You may not follow a bhikkhu’s speech against dhamma at all. If a bhikkhunī knows that a bhikkhu sangha in harmony has suspended a bhikkhu according to dhamma, but follows that bhikkhu, the other bhikkhunīs should say: “Sister, this bhikkhu has been suspended by a bhikkhu sangha in harmony according to dhamma. Don’t follow him.” If she, when admonished like this, holds firmly on to it and doesn’t give it up, they should admonish her a second and a third time. If she gives up this matter at the second or third admonishment, it’s fine. If not, she’s not a bhikkhunī, not a Sakyan daughter. You shouldn’t commit this for your whole life. If you can keep it, you should say: “I can.”

<lzh>「一切不應覆藏他麁惡罪。若比丘尼，知他比丘尼犯波羅夷罪。彼後時，若罷道、若死、若遠行、若被舉、若根變，語諸比丘尼，作如是語：『我先知是比丘尼犯波羅夷罪。』不白僧、不向人說，非比丘尼、非釋種女。是中盡形壽不應犯！」若能持，當言：「能！」</lzh>
You shouldn’t hide someone else’s coarse, unwholesome offense at all. If a bhikkunī knows that another bhikkhunī has committed a pārājika offense, and if she, when that (other bhikkhunī) later disrobes, dies, wanders far away, is expelled, or changes sex, says to the other bhikkhunīs: “I earlier knew that that bhikkhunī committed a pārājika offense, but I didn’t tell the sangha or another person,” she’s not a bhikkhunī, not a Sakyan daughter. You shouldn’t commit this for your whole life. If you can keep it, you should say: “I can.”

<lzh>「諸佛世尊善能說喻，示現現事：猶如針鼻缺，不復任針用；猶如人死，終不能以此身更生；猶如多羅樹心斷，不生不長；猶如石破，不可還合。若比丘尼，於此八法犯一一法，還得比丘尼，無有是處。」</lzh>
The Buddhas, the World-honored Ones, were able to teach in similes to elucidate and clarify these rules: Just as a needle with the eye broken off will no longer be used as a needle; or as a person who has died, can’t be born again in this body; or as a palmtree whose core has been cut, can’t bud and grow; or as a broken stone can’t be joined together again; so too, if a bhikkunī breaks any of these eight rules, there’s no possibility for her to become a bhikkhunī again.’

<lzh>復應語言：「汝某甲聽！如來、應供、等正覺說是八不可越法，汝盡形壽不應越。比丘尼半月應從比丘眾乞教誡人；比丘尼不應於無比丘處夏安居；比丘尼自恣時，應從比丘眾請三事見聞疑罪；式叉摩那學二歲戒已，應在二部僧中受具足戒；比丘尼不得罵比丘，不得於白衣家說比丘破威儀、破戒、破見；比丘尼不應舉比丘罪，比丘得呵比丘尼；比丘尼犯麁惡罪，應在二部僧中半月行摩那埵，半月行摩那埵已，應各二十僧中求出罪；比丘尼雖先受戒百歲，故應禮拜、起迎新受戒比丘。」</lzh>
They should say again: ‘So-and-so, listen. The Tathāgata, worthy of offerings and fully awakened, has spoken the eight rules not to be transgressed. You shouldn’t transgress them for you whole life. A bhikkhunī should ask the bhikkhu sangha every half-month for an instructor. A bhikkhunī shouldn’t enter the rains retreat in a place without bhikkhus. At the time of the invitation ceremony, a bhikkhunī should invite the bhikkhu sangha with regards to three things: offenses seen, heard, or suspected. A sikkhamānā who has trained in the precepts for two years should receive the full ordination in both sanghas. A bhikkhunī may not abuse a bhikkhu, and may not tell lay families that a bhikkhu has broken proper conduct, has broken the precepts, or broken right view. A bhikkhunī shouldn’t bring up a bhikkhu’s offense, but a bhikkhu may criticize a bhikkhunī. If a bhikkhunī commits a coarse, unwholesome offense, she should undergo probation<note>Mānatta.</note> for half a month in both sanghas. When she has undergone probation for half a month, she should ask for rehabilitation in both sanghas of 20 persons each. Even if a bhikkhunī has been ordained for 100 years, she should pay respect, get up, and welcome a newly ordained bhikkhu.’

<lzh>復應語言：「汝某甲聽！如來、應供、等正覺說是四依法，盡形壽依是出家受具足戒。依糞掃衣，出家受具足戒。」若能，當言：「能！」</lzh>
They should say again: ‘So-and-so, listen. The Tathāgata, worthy of offerings and fully awakened, has spoken the four supports. Relying on these for one’s whole life, one goes forth and receives the full ordination. Relying on rag robes, one goes forth and receives the full ordination.

They should say again: ‘So-and-so, listen. You’ve received the full ordination in a formal act with a motion as fourth, a formal act according to dhamma. Gods, dragons, spirits, and gandhabbas often have this wish: “When will we obtain a human body, go forth, and receive the full ordination?” You’ve now obtained that. As people obtain kingship, you’ve now received the state of a bhikkhunī in the same way. You should be easy to speak to, and easily accept instruction. You should train in the three categories of precepts, cut off the three poisons, leave the three realms, and attain the fruit of arahantship. As for the other things that you don’t know, your preceptor and teachers will explain them to you.’”


<h2>(MiDm26) Ordination by messenger</h2>

<lzh>時有一婬女名半迦尸，於正法律出家，欲往阿練若住處受具足戒。諸賊聞之欲逆道伺取，彼女人亦聞不敢去。諸比丘尼以是白佛，佛言：「聽白四羯磨遙為受具足戒。」</lzh>
Then there was a prostitute called Aḍḍhakāsi who had gone forth in the true dhamma and vinaya, and wanted to go to a wilderness residence to receive the full ordination. Criminals heard it and wanted to infest the path and wait there to abduct her. The woman also heard about it and didn’t dare to go. The bhikkhunīs told the Buddha of this. The Buddha said: “I allow to receive the full ordination from a distance in a formal act with a motion as fourth.

<lzh>彼和尚、阿闍梨先為集十比丘尼僧，與受戒竟，置受戒人著一處；將十比丘尼僧往阿練若處，皆禮比丘僧足。</lzh>
Her preceptor and teachers first gather a sangha of 10 bhikkhunīs and give her the ordination. They leave the candidate in one place and lead the sangha of 10 bhikkhunīs to the wilderness place. They all pay respect at the bhikkhu sangha’s feet.

<lzh>羯磨師為從僧乞戒言：「大德僧聽！某甲，求某甲受具足戒；已於一眾中受具足戒竟，清淨無諸難事、已學二歲戒滿、先所應作已作、衣鉢具足、已求和尚、父母聽許、不犯麁惡罪，欲受具足戒；今從僧乞受具足戒，和尚某甲。願僧濟拔之，憐愍故！」如是三乞。</lzh>
The (bhikkhunīs’) master of ceremony asks the (bhikkhu) sangha for the ordination: ‘Venerables, may the sangha listen. So-and-so asks for the full ordination from So-and-so. She has already received the full ordination in one sangha, is pure and without difficulties, has finished training in the precepts for two years, what should have been done first has been done, her robes and bowl are complete, she has requested a preceptor, her parents have allowed it, she hasn’t committed a coarse, unwholesome offense, and she wants to receive the full ordination. She now asks the sangha for the full ordination, with her preceptor So-and-so. May the sangha save her out of compassion.’ She asks like this three times.

<lzh>比丘羯磨師應以其乞辭如上白四羯磨。羯磨已，和尚、阿闍梨，將十比丘尼僧還至本受戒處，呼受戒人，令禮僧足，在羯磨師前䠒跪合掌。羯磨師為說僧所作白四羯磨，令聽已，然後如上具說八墮法、四譬喻法、八不可越法、四依法，乃至「餘所不知者，和尚、阿闍梨當為汝說。」</lzh>
The bhikkhus’ master of ceremony should at her request speak the formal act with a motion as forth as above. When the formal act is finished, the preceptor and teachers lead the sangha of 10 bhikkhunīs back to their original place of the ordination ceremony. They summon the candidate, have her pay respect at the sangha’s feet, and kneel down with joined palm in front of the master or ceremony. The master of ceremony tells her of the formal act with a motion as fourth done by the sangha. Having made her understand, she then fully explains the eight rules of downfall, the four similes to elucidate the rules, the eight rules not to be transgressed, and the four supports, as above, down to ‘As for the other things that you don’t know, your preceptor and teachers will explain them to you.’”

<lzh>有諸比丘尼著光色衣，以為飾好。諸白衣譏呵言：「此比丘尼似婬女，欲求男子！」諸比丘尼以是白佛，佛言：「不應爾，犯者突吉羅！」</lzh>
(MiDm27) There were bhikkhunīs who wore brightly colored robes to dress up and look good. The lay people criticized them: “These bhikkhunīs are like prostitutes, they want to look for a man.” The bhikkhunīs told the Buddha of this. The Buddha said: “You shouldn’t do this. You commit a dukkaṭa.” 

<lzh>有諸比丘尼畫眼，佛言：「不應爾，犯者突吉羅！」</lzh>
(MiDm28) There were bhikkhunīs who applied makeup on their eyes. The Buddha said: “You shouldn’t do this. You commit a dukkaṭa.” 

<lzh>有諸比丘尼患眼須畫，佛言：「病者聽畫。」</lzh>
(MiDm29) There were bhikkhunīs who had an eye infection and needed to apply something. The Buddha said: “If you’re sick, I allow to apply something.”

<lzh>有諸比丘尼在比丘前行，佛言：「不應爾，犯者突吉羅！」</lzh>
(MiDm30) There were bhikkhunīs who walked in front of bhikkhus. The Buddha said: “You shouldn’t do this. You commit a dukkaṭa.” 

<lzh>有諸比丘尼遙見比丘來，便住不敢前去，妨乞食。佛言：「若去遠者，聽在前行。」</lzh>
(MiDm31) There were bhikkhunīs who, when they saw a bhikkhu coming in the distance, stayed put and didn’t dare to walk in front. They were prevented from going on almsround. The Buddha said: “If he walks far away, I allow to walk in front.”

<lzh>有諸比丘尼在比丘前嗅氣唾地，佛言：「不應爾，犯者突吉羅！」</lzh>
(MiDm32) There were bhikkhunīs who sniffed the air and spat on the ground in front of bhikkhus. The Buddha said: “You shouldn’t do this. You commit a dukkaṭa.” 

<lzh>有諸比丘尼加趺坐，月水出污脚跟，人見譏呵；又有一比丘尼加趺坐，蜣蜋虫入女根中，以此致病。白佛，佛言：「一切比丘尼皆應累趺坐，若加趺坐應互伸一脚，犯者突吉羅！」</lzh>
(MiDm33) There were bhikkhunīs who sat in the lotus position. Menstrual fluid came out and soiled their heels. When people saw it, they critized them. There was also one bhikkhunī who sat in the lotus position and dung beetles and bugs entered into her vagina. From this she became sick. They told the Buddha, and the Buddha said: “All bhikkhunīs should sit in lazy lotus. If they sit in full lotus, they should alternate stretching out a foot. (Otherwise,) you commit a dukkaṭa.”

<lzh>有居士欲與比丘尼貿易住處，諸比丘尼不敢。佛言：「聽與貿易。」</lzh>
(MiDm34) There were householders who wanted to exchange residences with the bhikkhunīs. The bhikkhunīs didn’t dare to do it. The Buddha said: “I allow to do an exchange.”

<lzh>有諸比丘尼如刺靴法，張衣刺。佛言：「不應爾！若衣捲縮，聽安綦。」</lzh>
(MiDm35) There were bhikkhunīs who, as in the rule about piercing boots, stretched their robes and pierced them. The Buddha said: “You shouldn’t do this. If the robe curls up and has shrunk, I allow to attach a border.”

<lzh>有諸比丘尼於住處，處處大小便，臭穢。佛言：「不應爾，犯者突吉羅！應作廁。」</lzh>
(MiDm36) There were bhikkhunīs who urinated and defecated everywhere in the residence, and it stank and was dirty. The Buddha said: “You shouldn’t do this. You commit a dukkaṭa. You should build a toilet.” 

<lzh>諸比丘尼深作廁坑，落胎著中，除糞人見，譏呵言：「此輩常讚歎離欲、欲想、欲熱；而行其事，恐人知之，落胎廁中。何不罷道，受五欲樂？」諸比丘尼以是白佛，佛言：「不應深作廁坑；極深聽捲手一肘，小作口。」</lzh>
(MiDm37) The bhikkhunīs built a deep toilet pit, and placed aborted fetuses inside. The remover of excrements saw it and criticized them: “These people always praise abandoning desire, thoughts of desire, and the heat of desire. But they engage in this thing, fear that people will know about it, and drop fetuses into the toilet! Why don’t they disrobe and experience the five pleasures?” The bhikkhunīs told the Buddha of this. The Buddha said: “You shouldn’t build deep toilet pits. The most depth that I allow is one forearm’s length deep with the hand tilted up, and to make the opening small.” 

<lzh>有諸比丘尼以鉢及囊盛胎，晨朝棄之。時波斯匿王邊境有事，遣軍征之，有信樂佛法者，作是念：「我今當先與出家人食，然後乃行。」即遣信覓，遇見彼比丘尼，請還施食。比丘尼言：「汝並前去，我隨後往。」便苦請之，強將俱還；出鉢下食，見小兒胎，便種種譏呵言：「此等常說慈愍護念眾生，而今親自殺兒。無沙門行，破沙門法！」諸比丘尼以是白諸比丘，諸比丘以是白佛，佛言：「若比丘尼乞食時見比丘，應出鉢示。」</lzh>
(MiDm38) There were bhikkhunīs who filled up their bowls and bags with a fetus, and threw them away at dawn. Then there was a problem in king Pasenadi’s border lands, and he sent the army there. Someone who had joyous faith in the Buddha’s dhamma thought: “I’ll now first give a meal to someone gone forth, and then go.” Then he sent messengers to search for one, and they came across such a bhikkhunī and invited her to return with them for a meal offering. The bhikkhunī said: “You go ahead, I’ll follow behind you.” They again earnestly invited her, and then took her forcefully back there. They took out the bowl to put food in, and saw the small baby fetus. Then they criticized her in all kinds of ways: “These people always say that they’ve compassion and think about protecting all beings, but now she has killed a baby herself. This isn’t the practice of renunciates. She has broken the rules of renunciates.” The bhikkhunīs told the bhikkhus of this, and the bhikkhus told the Buddha. The Buddha said: “If a bhikkhunī on almsround sees a bhikkhu, she should take out her bowl and show him.”

<lzh>諸比丘尼便都出鉢傾側示之，以妨乞食。佛言：「但粗示，令知其空。」</lzh>
(MiDm39) The bhikkhunīs then all took out their bowls, showed them tilted to one side, and were prevented from almsround. The Buddha said: “Just show it superficially, to let them know it’s empty.”

<lzh>有比丘尼產一男兒，不知云何？以是白佛，佛言：「聽白二羯磨差一比丘尼伴之！」</lzh>
(MiDm40) There was a bhikkhunī who gave birth to a baby boy. They didn’t know what to do. They told the Buddha of this, and the Buddha said: “I allow to choose one bhikkhunī as her companion in a formal act with a motion as second.

<lzh>應一比丘尼僧中唱言：「阿姨僧聽！此某甲比丘尼生男兒，今差某甲比丘尼伴之。若僧時到僧忍聽。白如是。」</lzh>
One bhikkhunī should announce in the sangha: ‘Venerables, may the sangha listen. This bhikkhunī So-and-so has given birth to a baby boy. Now we choose bhikkhunī So-and-so as her companion. If the right time has come for the sangha, may the sangha approve it. This is the motion.’

<lzh>「阿姨僧聽！此某甲比丘尼生男兒，今差某甲比丘尼伴之。誰諸阿姨忍，默然；不忍者，說。僧已差某甲比丘尼，伴某甲比丘尼竟；僧忍，默然故。是事如是持。」</lzh>
‘Venerables, may the sangha listen. This bhikkhunī So-and-so has given birth to a baby boy. Now we choose bhikkhunī So-and-so as her companion. Those of the venerables who accept it should remain silent. Those who don’t accept it should speak. The sangha has chosen bhikkhunī So-and-so as companion for bhikkhunī So-and-so. The sangha accepts this, therefore you’re silent. This matter is remembered thus.’”

<lzh>二比丘尼捉兒生疑，佛言：「無犯！」</lzh>
(MiDm41) Both bhikkhunīs held the baby, and doubts arose. The Buddha said: “There’s no offense.”

<lzh>二比丘尼共兒眠生疑，佛言：「亦無犯！」</lzh>
(MiDm42) Both bhikkhunīs slept together with the baby, and doubts arose. The Buddha said: “There’s also no offense.”

<lzh>莊嚴兒，共嗚。佛言：「不應爾！聽洗浴，與乳哺。若離懷抱，應與比丘令出家；若不欲令出家，應與親，親養令長成。」</lzh>
(MiDm43) They adorned the baby and kissed it. The Buddha said: “You shouldn’t do this. I allow to bathe him and to breast-feed him. When he’s weaned, you should give him to the bhikkhus to let him go forth. If you don’t want to let him go forth, you should give him to relatives, and the relatives will raise him until he grows up.”

<lzh>有諸比丘尼，比丘僧請不次第往。佛言：「不應爾！應次第差往。」</lzh>
(MiDm44) There were bhikkhunīs who didn’t go in order of seniority to the invitation of the bhikkhu sangha. The Buddha said: “You shouldn’t do this. You should send them to go there in order.”

<lzh>有諸比丘尼入聚落，不繫下衣，墮地露形。佛言：「應以腰繩繫之。」</lzh>
(MiDm45) There were bhikkhunīs who entered the village and hadn’t tied their lower robe. It fell to the ground and exposed their bodies. The Buddha said: “You should tie it with a waistband.”

<lzh>作腰繩大長，佛言：「聽繞腰一匝。」</lzh>
(MiDm46) They made the waistbands large and long. The Buddha said: “I allow to wind it around the hips once.”

<lzh>作腰繩大廣，佛言：「極廣聽廣一指。」</lzh>
(MiDm47) They made the waistbands large and wide. The Buddha said: “The most width that I allow is one finger(breadth) wide.”

<lzh>作雜色腰繩，佛言：「不應爾！聽純一色。」</lzh>
(MiDm48) They made waistbands in various colors. The Buddha said: “You shouldn’t do this. I allow one uniform color.”

<lzh>有諸比丘尼著輕衣入聚落，風吹露形。佛言：「聽上下安鉤紐、帶繫之。」</lzh>
(MiDm49) There were bhikkhunīs who wore light robes and entered the village. The wind blew and exposed their bodies. The Buddha said: “You should place hooks and buttons at the top and the bottom, and tie a belt.”

<lzh>有諸貴姓女出家擎鉢乞食，手寄。佛言：「聽作絡囊盛鉢乞食。」</lzh>
(MiDm50) There were women who had gone forth from noble clans. When they held the bowl on almsround, they had to hold up their hands. The Buddha said: “I allow to make a sling bag, and to put the bowl inside on almsround.”

<lzh>掛腋下，汗污、塵入。佛言：「聽作覆鉢巾。」</lzh>
(MiDm51) They hung it under their armpits, and sweat soiled it, and dust got inside. The Buddha said: “I allow to make a bowl-covering cloth.”

<lzh>有諸比丘尼作蠱道，欲殺眾生。佛言：「若作蠱道，欲殺眾生，偷羅遮；作呪術起死人，欲殺眾生，亦如是。」</lzh>
(MiDm52) There were bhikkhunīs who performed incantations, wanting to kill living beings. The Buddha said: “If you perform incantations, wanting to kill living beings, it’s a thullaccaya. If you use magic arts to raise the dead, wanting to kill living beings, it’s the same.”

<lzh>有諸比丘尼畜種種雜色衣，諸白衣譏呵言：「此諸比丘尼正似婬女！」佛言：「不應爾，犯者突吉羅！」</lzh>
(MiDm53) There were bhikkhunīs who kept all kinds of cloths of various colors. The lay people criticized them: “These bhikkhunīs are truly like prostitutes.” The Buddha said: “You shouldn’t do this. You commit a dukkaṭa.”

<lzh>諸比丘有宿食，諸比丘尼無食，不敢與。佛言：「聽與無犯。比丘尼宿食與比丘，亦如是。」</lzh>
(MiDm54) The bhikkhus had stored food, and the bhikkhunīs had no food. They didn’t dare to give it to them. The Buddha said: “I allow to give it without offense. If bhikkhunīs give stored food to bhikkhus, it’s the same.”

<lzh>有諸比丘至比丘尼住處，無淨人授食。佛言：「無淨人時，聽比丘尼授食與比丘，無犯。比丘授食與比丘尼，亦如是。」</lzh>
(MiDm55) There were bhikkhus who went to the bhikkhunīs’ residence, and there was no attendant to offer the food. The Buddha said: “If there’s no attendant, I allow that the bhikkhunīs offer the food to the bhikkhus without offense. If bhikkhus offer food to the bhikkhunīs, it’s the same.”

<lzh>有諸比丘尼作酒沽，多人譏呵。佛言：「不應爾，犯者偷羅遮！」</lzh>
(MiDm56) There were bhikkhunīs who made alcohol and sold it. Many people criticized them. The Buddha said: “You shouldn’t do this. You commit a thullaccaya.” 

<lzh>有諸比丘尼畜田、犁牛、奴，自看耕種。諸白衣譏呵：「此諸比丘尼亦自看耕田，與我何異？」佛言：「不應自看，應使淨人知。犯者突吉羅！」</lzh>
(MiDm57) There were bhikkhunīs who kept fields, plows, oxen, and slaves, and they themselves supervised the plowing and sowing. The lay people criticized them: “These bhikkhunīs also supervise the plowing of the fields, what’s the difference to us?” the Buddha said: “You shouldn’t supervise it yourselves. You should let an attendant know. You commit a dukkaṭa.”

<lzh>有諸比丘尼出息，多人譏呵。佛言：「不應爾，犯者偷羅遮！」</lzh>
(MiDm58) There were bhikkhunīs who went out to make a living. Many people criticized them. The Buddha said: “You shouldn’t do this. You commit a thullaccaya.” 

<lzh>有諸比丘尼畜婬女，坐肆賃之；多人譏呵。佛言：「不應爾，犯者偷羅遮！」</lzh>
(MiDm59) There were bhikkhunīs who kept prostitutes. They sat in a shop and hired them out. Many people criticized them. The Buddha said: “You shouldn’t do this. You commit a thullaccaya.”

<lzh>有諸比丘尼壓油賣，多人譏呵。佛言：「不應爾，犯者偷羅遮！」</lzh>
(MiDm60) There were bhikkhunīs who pressed oil and sold it. Many people criticized them. The Buddha said: “You shouldn’t do this. You commit a thullaccaya.”

<lzh>有諸比丘尼躂脚戲，多人譏呵。佛言：「不應爾，犯者突吉羅！懸繩自掛戲，亦如是。」</lzh>
(MiDm61) There were bhikkhunīs who playfully stumbled over their feet. Many people criticized them. The Buddha said: “You shouldn’t do this. You commit a dukkaṭa. If you hang up a swing yourself to play, it’s the same.”

<lzh>有諸比丘尼住處失火，佛言：「應打揵搥，若唱令集，皆共救火，土坋、水澆、以水漬衣撲滅。」</lzh>
(MiDm62) There were bhikkhunīs whose residence caught fire. The Buddha said: “You should strike the bell, or to call everyone to gather. All should put out the fire together, by sprinkling earth, dust, or water, or by soaking robes with water and extinguishing it.”

<lzh>時有眾多居士請比丘尼僧食。諸比丘尼晨朝著衣持鉢，到請家方相問大小，日時遂過，居士譏呵：「此諸比丘尼正似婆羅門女！相問知經多少，多者為大。我今設供，日時已過，當如之何？」以是白佛，佛言：「若大眾會時，聽上座八人相問大小，以次坐，餘人得座便坐。」</lzh>
(MiDm63) Then there were many householders who invited the bhikkhunī sangha for a meal. At dawn, the bhikkhunīs put on their robes, took their bowls, and went to the inviting family. They asked each other for their seniority, and then the noon time passed. The householders criticized them: “These bhikkhunīs are truly like brahmin women. They ask each other to find out how much younger or older they are. We’ve now set up an offering, but the noon time has passed. Now what?” They told the Buddha of this, and the Buddha said: “When it’s an event for a large group, I allow the eight most senior persons to ask each other about their seniority to sit in order, and the other people may sit wherever they obtain a seat.”
