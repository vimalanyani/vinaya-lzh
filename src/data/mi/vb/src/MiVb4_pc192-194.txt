<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼自作畜眾羯磨、自作二歲學戒羯磨、自授二歲學戒，不能教誡弟子，愚闇無知不能學戒。諸長老比丘尼聞，種種呵責。乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs carried out the formal act to take on students themselves, they carried out the formal act for training two years in the precepts themselves, and they gave the training precepts for two years themselves. They weren’t able to instruct the students, and (the students) were ignorant and without knowledge, and unable to train in the precepts. When the senior bhikkhunīs heard it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus:
