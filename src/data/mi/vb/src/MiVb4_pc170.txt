<h2>First Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼非時到白衣家。有一家大富，賊常欲劫之，而未得便，借問行人：「誰出入此家者？」有人言：「偷羅難陀比丘尼與此家善，數相往返。」賊便往語偷羅難陀言：「阿姨！某甲喚汝。」即從語暮往，主人為開門，賊便突入，劫物蕩盡。主人瞋呵言：「若此比丘尼不非時來，我不開門，不遭此難！供養望福，而反致禍，與養怨家有何等異？」諸長老比丘尼種種呵責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs went to lay houses at the wrong time. There was one house with great wealth, and criminals always wanted to rob it, but hadn’t been able to yet. They asked passers-by: “Who enters and leaves this house?” Some people said: “Thullanandā bhikkhunī is on good terms with this family and often comes and goes.” The criminals then went and said to Thullanandā: “Venerable, So-and-so is summoning you.” She followed the words and went in the dark. The owner opened the gate for her, and the criminals then forced their way in and plundered everything. The owner complained angrily: “If this bhikkhunī hadn’t come at the wrong time, I wouldn’t have opened the door and encountered this trouble. We supported her hoping for merit, but instead it has brought us disaster. What’s the difference between a helper and an enemy?” The senior bhikkhunīs criticized her in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Preliminary Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，非時入白衣家，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī enters a lay house at the wrong time, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Second Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>復有諸比丘尼，白衣呼不敢往，以是白佛。佛以是事集二部僧，告諸比丘：「今聽比丘尼，白衣喚得往。從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
There were also bhikkhunīs who didn’t dare to go when lay people called them. They told the Buddha of this. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter and told the bhikkhus: “Now I allow the bhikkhunīs to go if lay people summon them. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，白衣不喚，非時入其家，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī hasn’t been summoned by lay people, and enters their house at the wrong time, it’s a pācittiya.’”

<lzh>非時者：從中後，至明相未出。</lzh>
“The wrong time” means from after noon to before the next dawn.

<lzh>若白衣喚，應詳察，彼使是可信人不？又應審問，知其虛實；若猶有疑，至門，應先問其家：「竟為喚不？」然後乃入。復應籌量，非是可畏時不？</lzh>
If a lay person summons her, she should examine if that messenger is a trustworthy person. She should also interrogate them to know if they’re fake or real. If she has doubts, then when she reaches the gate, she should first ask that family: “Did you really summon me?”, and then enter. She should also consider whether it’s not a fearful time.

<lzh>若非時往白衣家，一脚出門，突吉羅；兩脚出，波逸提。</lzh>
If she goes to a lay house at the wrong time, and steps outside the gate with one foot, it’s a dukkaṭa. If she steps outside with the second foot, it’s a pācittiya.

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼，突吉羅。</lzh>
For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.
