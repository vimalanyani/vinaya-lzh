Mahīśāsaka Vinaya, part 2.4, bhikkhunī vinaya, the pācittiya rules.


<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛城。爾時優波離問佛：「世尊已為諸比丘結戒：『若比丘，故妄語，波逸提。』乃至『若比丘，知檀越欲與僧物，迴與餘人，波逸提。』我當云何持？」佛言：「應作二部僧持。從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
The Buddha was at Sāvatthī. At that time, Upāli asked the Buddha: “The World-honored One has laid down the precepts for the bhikkhus: ‘If a bhikkhu intentionally lies, it’s a pācittiya.’ … ‘If a bhikkhu knows that a supporter wants to give an item to the sangha, and he diverts it to someone else, it’s a pācittiya.’ How should I remember these?” The Buddha said: “You should remember them as to be practised by both sanghas. From now on, these precepts should be recited thus:

If a bhikkhunī arrives at the house of a lay person, and is invited and given much food and drinks, whether cakes or flour, and if she doesn’t stay in their house to eat them, she should accept two or three bowlfuls if she needs them.<note>I follow the text of the pātimokkha and the parallel bhikkhu rule for the translation: 須二三鉢應受.

If a bhikkhunī says: “According to my understanding, the things of which the Buddha said that they obstruct the path can’t obstruct the path,” the bhikkhunīs should say to her: “Don’t say this. Don’t slander the Buddha, don’t misrepresent the Buddha. The things of which the Buddha said that they obstruct the path really can obstruct the path. Give up this unwholesome wrong view.” If she, when admonished like this, holds firmly on to it and doesn’t give it up, they should admonish her a second and a third time. If she gives up this matter at the second or third admonishment, it’s fine. If not, it’s a pācittiya.

<lzh>「若沙彌尼作是語：『如我解佛所說，若受五欲，不能障道！』諸比丘尼語是沙彌尼：『汝莫作是語！莫謗佛，莫誣佛！佛說五欲障道，實能障道。汝沙彌尼捨是惡邪見！』如是教，堅持不捨，應第二、第三教。第二、第三教，捨是事善；若不捨，諸比丘尼應語是沙彌尼：『汝出去！從今莫言佛是我師，莫在諸比丘尼後行！如餘沙彌尼得共諸比丘尼二宿，汝亦無是事。癡人出去，滅去，莫此中住！』若比丘尼，知如法擯沙彌尼，畜、使、共住、共語，波逸提。」</lzh>
If a sāmaṇerī says: “According to my understanding of what the Buddha said, if one is subject to the five desires, it can’t obstruct the path,” the bhikkhunīs should say to that sāmaṇerī: “Don’t say this. Don’t slander the Buddha, don’t misrepresent the Buddha. The Buddha said that the five desires obstuct the path, and they really can obstruct the path. Sāmaṇerī, give up this unwholesome wrong view.” If she, when instructed like this, holds firmly on to it and doesn’t give it up, they should instruct her a second and a third time. If she gives up this matter at the second or third instruction, it’s fine. If not, the bhikkhunīs should say to that sāmaṇerī: “Go away! From now on, don’t say: ‘The Buddha is my teacher’, and don’t follow the bhikkhunīs around. Other sāmaṇerīs may stay together with the bhikkhunīs for two nights. You also may not do this. Go away, you fool, disappear! Don’t live here.” If a bhikkhunī knows that the sāmaṇerī has been expelled according to dhamma, and takes her in, lets her live with her, and speaks with her, it’s a pācittiya.

If a bhikkhunī, when the precepts are being recited, says: “I now only found out that this rule is recited in the precepts sutta every half-month at the uposatha,” and the bhikkhunīs know that this bhikkhunī already sat in the precepts recitation three times, this bhikkhunī may not be let off because of ignorance. They should deal with her according to the offense she committed in line with dhamma, and should criticize her ignorance: “What you did is unwholesome.
