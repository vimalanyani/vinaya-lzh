<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼作二歲學戒羯磨竟，經宿乃授其學戒，其中難起，遂不得受。諸長老比丘尼聞，種種呵責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs, when the formal act for training two years in the precepts had been carried out, let a night pass and then gave people the training precepts.

From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，作二歲學戒羯磨竟，經宿乃授其學戒，波逸提。」</lzh>

<lzh>不犯如上說。</lzh>
The non-offenses are as explained above.
