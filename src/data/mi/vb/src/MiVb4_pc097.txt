<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼在毘舍佉母所，作精舍安居竟，無所囑付，空寺出行。於後火起，有人見之，語毘舍佉母言：「汝所作比丘尼精舍，為火所燒！」彼便遣奴婢往救，得不燒盡。諸比丘尼後還，毘舍佉母問言：「阿姨！汝不失物不？」答言：「我失如是如是物！」遂過長說所失物，毘舍佉母訶責言：「云何在我精舍安居，不付囑而去？致使火燒，而復過長說所失物！」諸長老比丘尼聞，種種訶責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs were staying at a monastery built by mother Visākhā. When the rains retreat had ended, they left the monastery empty, and went wandering without handing it over. Later, a fire broke out there. People saw it and told mother Visākhā: “The bhikkhunī monastery you built is burnt by a fire.” She then sent male and female slaves to go and save it, and they managed to not let it burn down completely. When the bhikkhunīs later returned, mother Visākhā asked them: “Venerables, you haven’t lost any property, have you?” They answered: “We lost such and such things.” Thereupon, they spoke at length about the lost items. Mother Visākhā criticized them: “Why did you spend the rains retreat at my monastery, and left without handing it over? Because of this, it was burnt by fire, but again you spoke at length about your lost things.” When the senior bhikkhunīs heard it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，安居竟，不付囑精舍，出行者，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī, when the rains retreat has ended, goes wandering without handing over the monastery, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>若不付囑，行一脚出門，突吉羅；兩脚出門，波逸提。</lzh>
If she doesn’t hand it over and steps outside the gate with one foot, it’s a dukkaṭa. If she steps outside the gate with the second foot, it’s a pācittiya.

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼，突吉羅。</lzh>
For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>若更有比丘、比丘尼來住；若無人可付囑，不犯。</lzh>
If there still are bhikkhus or bhikkhunīs coming to stay, or if there’s nobody to whom one can hand over, the offense isn’t committed.
