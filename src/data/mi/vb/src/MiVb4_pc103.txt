<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼雖滿十二歲，而聾盲瘖瘂種種諸病，無所知，而畜弟子，不能教誡、不能攝取，弟子愚闇無知不能學戒。諸長老比丘尼見，種種訶責，以事白佛。佛以是事集二部僧，問諸比丘尼：「汝等實爾不？」答言：「實爾。世尊！」佛種種訶責言：「云何比丘尼盲聾瘖瘂種種諸病，而畜弟子，不能教誡，不能攝取，使弟子愚闇無知不能學戒？」訶已，告諸比丘：「今聽諸比丘尼白二羯磨畜眾。」彼比丘尼應到比丘尼僧中，脫革屣，偏袒右肩，胡跪合掌，白言：</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs, even if they had 12 vassa, took on students who were deaf, blind, mute, had all kinds of diseases, and were without any knowledge. They weren’t able to instruct or assist them, and the students were ignorant and without knowledge, and unable to train in the precepts. When the senior bhikkhunīs saw it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, and told the Buddha of this matter. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter and asked the bhikkhunīs: “Did you really do this?” They answered: “We really did it, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized them in all kinds of ways: “Why did the bhikkhunīs take on students who are blind, deaf, mute, and have all kinds of diseases, whom they’re not able to instruct and assist? Therefore the students are ignorant and without knowledge, and unable to train in the precepts.” Having criticized them, he told the bhikkhus: “I now allow the bhikkhunīs to do a formal act with a motion as second to take on students. Such a bhikkhunī should go into the midst of the bhikkhunī sangha, take off her leather sandals, uncover her right shoulder, kneel down, join her palms, and say: 

<lzh>「阿姨僧聽！我某甲比丘尼，已滿十二歲，欲畜眾；從僧乞畜眾羯磨。善哉！僧與我作畜眾羯磨。」如是三乞。</lzh>
‘Venerables, may the sangha listen. I, bhikkhunī So-and-so, have 12 vassa and want to take on students. I ask the sangha for the formal act to take on students. It’d be good if the sangha carried out a formal act to take on students for me.’ She asks like this three times.

<lzh>諸比丘尼應籌量觀察，此比丘尼堪畜眾不？若不堪，不應與作畜眾羯磨；若堪，應與作。應一比丘尼，若上座、若上座等，知法、知律者，唱言：</lzh>
The bhikkhunīs should evaluate and examine if this bhikkhunī is capable of taking on students or not. If she’s not capable, they shouldn’t carry out the formal act to take on students. If she’s capable, they should carry it out. One bhikkhunī, the most senior, or the next in line, one who knows the dhamma and the vinaya, should announce: 


<h2>Saṅghakamma</h2>

<lzh>「阿姨僧聽！此某甲比丘尼，已滿十二歲，欲畜某甲為眾；從僧乞畜眾羯磨，僧今與作畜眾羯磨。若僧時到僧忍聽。白如是。」</lzh>
‘Venerables, may the sangha listen. This bhikkhunī So-and-so has 12 vassa and wants to take on So-and-so as her student. She asks the sangha for the formal act to take on students. The sangha now carries out the formal act to take on students. If the right time has come for the sangha, may the sangha approve it. This is the motion.’

<lzh>「阿姨僧聽！此某甲比丘尼，已滿十二歲，欲畜某甲為眾；從僧乞畜眾羯磨，僧今與作畜眾羯磨。誰諸阿姨忍者，默然；若不忍者，便說。僧已與某甲比丘尼作畜眾羯磨竟；僧忍，默然故。是事如是持。」</lzh>
‘Venerables, may the sangha listen. This bhikkhunī So-and-so has 12 vassa and wants to take on So-and-so as her student. She asks the sangha for the formal act to take on students. The sangha now carries out the formal act to take on students. Those of the venerables who accept it, should remain silent. Those who don’t accept it should speak.’ ‘The sangha has carried out the formal act to take on students for bhikkhunī So-and-so. The sangha accepts this, therefore you’re silent. This matter is remembered thus.’ 


<h2>Origin Story (continued)</h2>

<lzh>「今為諸比丘尼結戒，從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus:


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，滿十二歲，僧不與作畜眾羯磨；畜眾者，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī, who has 12 vassa, takes on students when the sangha hasn’t carried out a formal act to take on students for her, it’s a pācittiya.’”
