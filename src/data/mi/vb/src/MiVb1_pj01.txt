<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛城。爾時長老優波離問佛：「世尊已為諸比丘結戒：『若比丘，共諸比丘同學戒法，戒羸不捨行婬法，乃至共畜生，是比丘得波羅夷，不共住。』是戒我當云何持？為應作一部僧持、二部僧持？」佛言：「應作二部僧持。從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
The Buddha was at Sāvatthī. At that time, the venerable Upāli asked the Buddha: “The World-honored One has laid down the precept for the bhikkhus: ‘If a bhikkhu who trains together with the other bhikkhus in the precepts and rules, whose precepts are weak, but who hasn’t given them up, engages in sexual intercourse even together with an animal, that bhikkhu incurs a pārājika and doesn’t live in community.’ How should I remember this precept? Should I remember it as to be practised by one sangha, or by both sanghas?” The Buddha said: “You should remember it as to be practised by both sanghas. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，共諸比丘尼同學戒法，戒羸不捨，隨意行婬，乃至共畜生，是比丘尼得波羅夷，不共住。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī who trains together with the other bhikkhunīs in the precepts and rules, whose precepts are weak, but who hasn’t given them up, intentionally engages in sexual intercourse even together with an animal, that bhikkhunī incurs a pārājika, and doesn’t live in community.’”
