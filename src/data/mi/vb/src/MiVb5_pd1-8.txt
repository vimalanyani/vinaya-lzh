<h2>First Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼好食酥，數從人乞。諸白衣譏呵言：「酥令人悅澤，世人所食。云何比丘尼不求法味？貪著嗜美，求好顏色，與婬女何異？無沙門行！破沙門法！」諸長老比丘尼聞，種種呵責，以是白佛。佛以是事集二部僧，問諸比丘尼：「汝等實爾不？」答言：「實爾。世尊！」佛種種呵責已，告諸比丘：「今為諸比丘尼結波羅提提舍尼法，從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs ate delicious ghee and often asked for it from people. The lay people criticized them: “Ghee is for people’s enjoyment, it’s what worldly people eat. Why don’t the bhikkhunīs seek the flavor of dhamma? They crave, are attached to, and are addicted to beauty, and they seek a beautiful appearance. What’s the difference to prostitutes? This isn’t the practice of renunciates. They’ve broken the rules of renunciates.” When the senior bhikkhunīs heard it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, and told the Buddha of this. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter and asked the bhikkhunīs: “Did you really do this?” They answered: “We really did this, World-honored One.” When the Buddha had criticized them in all kinds of ways, he told the bhikkhus: “I now lay down a pātidesanīya rule for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>First Preliminary Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，食酥，應諸比丘尼邊悔過：『我墮可呵法，今向諸阿姨悔過！』是名悔過法。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī eats ghee, she should confess to the other bhikkhunīs: “I’ve fallen into an offense to be criticized. I now confess it to the venerables.” This is called an offense to be confessed.’”


<h2>Second Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>時諸比丘尼於僧中食、請家食及乞食，得酥不敢噉。以是白佛。佛以是事集二部僧，告諸比丘：「今聽比丘尼不乞，得酥應噉。從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
Then the bhikkhunīs received ghee at sangha meals, when being invited to meals in families, and on almsround, and they didn’t dare to eat it. They told the Buddha of this. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter and told the bhikkhus: “I now allow the bhikkhunīs to eat ghee they’ve obtained without asking. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Second Preliminary Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，乞酥食。是比丘尼應諸比丘尼邊悔過：『我墮可呵法，今向諸阿姨悔過！』是名悔過法。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī asks for ghee and eats it, that bhikkhunī should confess to the other bhikkhunīs: “I’ve fallen into an offense to be criticized. I now confess it to the venerables.” This is called an offense to be confessed.’”


<h2>Third Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>有諸病比丘尼須酥，不敢乞。以是白佛。佛以是事集二部僧，告諸比丘：「今聽病比丘尼乞酥食。從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
There were sick bhikkhunīs who needed ghee and didn’t dare to ask. They told the Buddha of this. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter and told the bhikkhus: “I now allow sick bhikkhunīs to ask for ghee and eat it. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，無病自為乞酥食。是比丘尼應諸比丘尼邊悔過：『我墮可呵法，今向諸阿姨悔過！』是名悔過法。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī, who isn’t sick, asks for ghee herself and eats it, that bhikkhunī should confess to the other bhikkhunīs: “I’ve fallen into an offense to be criticized. I now confess it to the venerables.” This is called an offense to be confessed.’”
