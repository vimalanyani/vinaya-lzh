<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼多聚積鉢，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs accumulated many bowls … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus:


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，多積聚鉢，尼薩耆波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī accumulates many bowls, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>聽畜七種麁鉢：一以盛飲食、二以盛香、三以盛藥、四以盛殘食、五以除唾、六以除掃、七以除小便。</lzh>
It’s allowed to keep seven kinds of coarse bowls: 1. to hold food and drinks, 2. to hold perfumes, 3. to hold medicines, 4. to hold leftover food, 5. as a spittoon, 6. as a garbage bin, 7. as a urine pot.

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼，突吉羅。</lzh>
For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>(捨墮竟)</lzh>
(End of the nissaggiya pācittiyas.)
