<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼在毘舍佉母精舍安居竟，不捨精舍還主，而去。於後火起，有人見之，語毘舍佉母言：「汝所作比丘尼精舍，為火所燒！」毘舍佉母言：「置使燒盡！先諸比丘尼不付囑出行，致使失火。後還，復過長說所失物，貽我惡名！」彼比丘尼後復還來，毘舍佉母問言：「阿姨！去時留物精舍中不？」答言：「無！」便訶責言：「云何去，不還我精舍，致使燒盡？若語我者，自當守護，不使致此！」諸長老比丘尼聞，種種訶責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>

Later they returned, spoke at length about their lost things, and gave me a bad reputation.” Those bhikkhunīs later returned again, and mother Visākhā asked them: “Venerables, when you left, did you leave things in the monastery, or not?” They answered: “No.” Then she criticized them: “Why did you leave without returning the monastery to me? Because of this, it burnt down. If you had spoken with me, I’d have looked after it myself and this wouldn’t have happened.” When the senior bhikkhunīs heard it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus:
