<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼作二歲學戒竟羯磨，經宿乃與授具足戒，中間有難，遂不得受具足戒。諸長老比丘尼聞，種種呵責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs, when the formal act for the completion of the two years of training in the precepts had been carried out, let a night pass and then gave people the full ordination. In the meantime, there were difficulties, and thereupon, they weren’t able to receive the full ordination. When the senior bhikkhunīs heard it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，作二歲學戒竟羯磨，經宿乃授具足戒，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī, when the formal act for the completion of the two years of training in the precepts has been carried out, lets a night pass and then gives the full ordination, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>發心，乃至明相未出，突吉羅。明相出已，和尚，波逸提；餘師眾，突吉羅。</lzh>
From when she thinks about it up to when it’s not dawn yet, it’s a dukkaṭa. At dawn, it’s a pācittiya for the preceptor. For the other teachers and the sangha, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>若病，若難起，若僧不集會，不犯。</lzh>
If she’s sick, if difficulties arise, or if the sangha hasn’t assembled, the offense isn’t committed.
