<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時闡陀比丘數數犯罪：上床、下床皆不如法，數數食，別眾食，非時入聚落不白善比丘；比丘僧與作不見罪羯磨。其姊比丘尼名優蹉，來往共語，及與衣食。諸比丘尼見，語言：「姊妹！此比丘，比丘僧已和合與作不見罪羯磨。諸比丘已不共住、不共事、不共語。汝今云何來往共語，與其衣食？」優蹉言：「此是我弟！我若不視，誰當視者？」</lzh>
At that time, Chanda bhikkhu<note>This bhikkhu is probably the same person as the Pāli tradition’s bhikkhu Channa, who in lay life had been the Buddha’s charioteer.</note> often committed offenses. From getting up to going to bed, everything wasn’t according to dhamma: he ate often, he ate in a separate group, and he entered the village at the wrong time without informing a good bhikkhu. The bhikkhu sangha carried out a formal act for not seeing offenses against him. His older sister, a bhikkhunī called Youcuo, came and went, talked with him, and she gave him robes and food. The bhikkhunīs saw it and said: “Sister, the bhikkhu sangha in harmony has carried out a formal act for not seeing offenses against this bhikkhu. The bhikkhus already don’t live with him, don’t conduct their matters with him, and don’t talk with him. Why do you now come and go, talk with him, and give him robes and food?” Youcuo said: “This is my younger brother. If I don’t look after him, who will?” 

<lzh>諸長老比丘尼種種呵責，以事白佛。佛以是事集二部僧，問優蹉：「汝實爾不？」答言：「實爾。世尊！」佛種種呵責已，告諸比丘：「應令一比丘尼與優蹉親善者往屏處諫：『汝莫隨順僧羯磨不見罪比丘！』若受者善；若不受，應眾多比丘尼往諫，若受者善；若復不受，復應比丘尼僧往諫。」諸比丘受教勅，諸比丘尼令一比丘尼往諫，乃至比丘尼僧往諫，皆不受。諸長老比丘尼以事白佛。佛以是事集二部僧，種種遙呵責優蹉已，告諸比丘：「今為諸比丘尼結戒，從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
The senior bhikkhunīs criticized her in all kinds of ways, and told the Buddha of this matter. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter and asked Youcuo: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” When the Buddha had criticized her in all kinds of ways, he told the bhikkhus: “They should have a bhikkhunī who is friends with Youcuo go to a secluded place and admonish her: ‘Don’t follow a bhikkhu against whom the sangha has made a formal act for not seeing offenses.’ If she accepts it, it’s fine. If she doesn’t accept it, a group of bhikkhunīs should go and admonish her. If she accepts it, it’s fine. If she again doesn’t accept it, the bhikkhunī sangha should also go and admonish her.” The bhikkhus received this instruction, and the bhikkhunīs had a bhikkhunī go and admonish her … the bhikkhunī sangha went and admonished her, but she didn’t accept anything. The senior bhikkhunīs told the Buddha of this matter. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter and when he had criticized Youcuo in all kinds of ways from afar, he told the bhikkhus: “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus:

<h2>Final Ruling</h2></h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，知僧如法與比丘作不見罪羯磨，諸比丘不共住、不共事、不共語，而隨順之。諸比丘尼語是比丘尼：『姊妹！此比丘，比丘僧已作不見罪羯磨，諸比丘不共住、不共事、不共語，汝莫隨順！』如是諫，堅持不捨；應第二、第三諫。第二、第三諫，捨是事善；不捨者，是比丘尼得波羅夷，不共住。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī knows that the sangha has carried out a formal act for not seeing offenses according to dhamma against a bhikkhu, and that the bhikkhus don’t live with him, don’t conduct their matters with him, and don’t talk with him, but she follows him, the other bhikkhunīs should tell that bhikkhunī: “Sister, the bhikkhu sangha has carried out a formal act for not seeing offenses against this bhikkhu. The bhikkhus don’t live with him, don’t conduct their matters with him, and don’t talk with him. Don’t follow him.” If she, when admonished like this, holds firmly on to it and doesn’t give it up, they should admonish her a second and a third time. If she gives up this matter at the second or third admonishment, it’s fine. If not, that bhikkhunī incurs a pārājika, and doesn’t live in community.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>餘皆如調達破僧中說。不犯亦如彼說。</lzh>
The remainder is all as explained in “Devadatta splits the sangha”. The non-offenses are also as explained there.
