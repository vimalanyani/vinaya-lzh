<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼共私論議：「我等出家當得究竟？為不得究竟？為應罷道、不應罷道？若罷道者，得好婿不？兒子多少？相祿云何？」因此論說，生世俗情，不復樂道，遂致反俗、作外道者。諸長老比丘尼聞，種種呵責言：「云何比丘尼作世俗論，以忘道意？」乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs privately discussed with each other: “Will we, having gone forth, attain the final goal? Will we not attain the final goal? Should we disrobe? Should we not disrobe? If we disrobe, will we obtain a good husband? How many children will we have? What will their appearance and wealth be like?” Because they had such discussions, worldly feelings arose, and they were no longer happy on the path. Thereupon, they returned to lay life, or became non-Buddhist renunciates. When the senior bhikkhunīs heard it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways: “Why do bhikkhunīs engage in worldly discussions, and therefore forget the intentions of the path?” … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī goes along with worldly discussions, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>
