<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼與弟子受具足戒，不將離其本處，先知識男子見生染著心，便調弄，共作麁惡婬欲語。諸長老比丘尼見，種種呵責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs gave the full ordination to students, and didn’t take them away from their original place. When their former male aquaintances saw them, defiled attachment arose in their minds, and they then fooled around and spoke coarse, unwholesome words about sexual desire. When the senior bhikkhunīs saw it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，畜弟子不自將，不使人將離本處五、六由旬，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī takes on a student, and doesn’t take her away herself or has others take her away from her original place five or six yojanas, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>本處者：若生處、若嫁處。</lzh>
“Her original place” means her birthplace, or the place where she married.

<lzh>若弟子不從者，不犯。</lzh>
If the student isn’t from there, the offense isn’t committed.
