<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼，非時衣作時衣受，諸客比丘尼便不能得衣。諸長老比丘尼見，種種訶責，以事白佛。佛以是事集二部僧，問諸比丘尼：「汝等實爾不？」答言：「實爾。世尊！」佛種種訶責已，告諸比丘：「今為諸比丘尼結戒，從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>

The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter and asked the bhikkhunīs: “Did you really do this?” They answered: “We really did this, World-honored One.” When the Buddha had criticized them in all kinds of ways, he told the bhikkhus: “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，非時衣作時衣受，尼薩耆波逸提。」</lzh>

This cloth should be relinquished to the sangha. It shouldn’t be relinquished to one, two, or three bhikkhunīs.

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼，突吉羅。</lzh>
For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.
