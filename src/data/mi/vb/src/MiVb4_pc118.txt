<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼，年年與弟子受具足戒，弟子眾多不能一一教誡，愚闇無知不能學戒。諸長老比丘尼見，種種呵責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs gave the full ordination to students every year. There were many students, and they were unable to instruct each one of them. They were ignorant and without knowledge, and weren’t able to train in the precepts. When the senior bhikkhunīs saw it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，年年與弟子受具足戒，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī gives the full ordination to a student every year, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼隔一年，得與一弟子受具足戒。</lzh>
A bhikkhunī may give the full ordination to one student every other year. 

<lzh>餘如畜眷屬中說。</lzh>
The remainder is as explained in “taking on a disciple”.
