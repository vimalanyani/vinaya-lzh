<h2>First Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時差摩比丘尼聰明機辯，難問諸比丘。諸比丘不能答，便大羞恥，後見諸比丘尼輒下路避之，遂無復教誡比丘尼者，愚闇無知不能學戒。諸長老比丘尼聞，種種呵責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, Khemā bhikkhunī was intelligent and good at debating. She asked the bhikkhus about something difficult. The bhikkhus weren’t able to answer and felt greatly ashamed. Later when they saw bhikkhunīs, they just left the road and avoided them. Thereupon nobody instructed the bhikkhunīs anymore. They were ignorant and without knowledge, and not able to train in the precepts. When the senior bhikkhunīs heard it, they criticized her in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Preliminary Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，問難比丘，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī asks a bhikkhu about something difficult, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Second Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>有諸比丘尼有疑，不敢問難，以此復愚闇無知不能學戒。以是白佛。佛以是事集二部僧，告諸比丘：「今聽諸比丘尼先白比丘，聽問者問。從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
There were bhikkhunīs who had doubts and didn’t dare to ask about something difficult. Because of this, they were also ignorant and without knowledge, and not able to train in the precepts. They told the Buddha of this. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter and told the bhikkhus: “I now allow the bhikkhunīs to first address a bhikkhu, and if he allows to ask, then ask. From now on, this precept should be recited thus:


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，不白比丘，輒問義者，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī without addressing a bhikkhu just asks him a question, it’s a pācittiya.’”

For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.
