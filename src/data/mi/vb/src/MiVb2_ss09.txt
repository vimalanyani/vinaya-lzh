<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時彼估客復作是念：「我先以食誘彼比丘尼，日月淺近是以不果？今當更以食誘引，久意或迴！」便到其所語言：「我先虛戲，遂至不遜，願受我悔過！從今如先從我取食。」彼比丘尼言：「止，止！男子！汝先惱我，使佛苦責，為諸比丘尼結戒。今日何應再見點辱？」彼比丘尼和尚語言：「汝先能得多美飲食，今何故不復能得？」答言：「彼人先惱觸我，佛因制戒，不敢復取！」和尚復言：「汝但莫生染著，取食何苦？若他生染著，何豫汝事？」彼比丘尼嫌訶和尚言：「佛種種毀訾親近男子，讚歎遠離。云何教我取染著心男子飲食？」</lzh>
At that time, that merchant thought: “Earlier I tempted that bhikkhunī with food. But the time was too short, therefore there was no result. I’ll now entice her with food again. Maybe she’ll return my long-standing intentions.” Then he went to her place and said: “Previously, I vainly messed around and thereupon, I became impertinent. Please accept my apology. From now on, take food from me as before.” The bhikkhunī said: “Stop, stop! Man, you previously made trouble for me. Because of that, the Buddha severely scolded me and laid down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. Why should I now see this disgrace again?” Her bhikkhunī preceptor told her: “Previously, you could obtain many delicious foods and drinks. Why shouldn’t you obtain them again now?” She answered: “That person previously molested me. For this reason, the Buddha has laid down a precept. I don’t dare to take it again.” The preceptor said again: “Just don’t give rise to defiled attachment. Then what harm is there in taking food? If he gives rise to defiled attachment, how is that your problem?” This bhikkhunī criticized her preceptor: “The Buddha disparaged being close to men in all kinds of ways, and praised keeping away. Why do you instruct me to take food and drinks from a man who has defiled attachment in his mind?”
<lzh>諸比丘尼聞，訶責彼師言：「云何教弟子受染著心男子食？」種種呵責已，以事白佛。佛以是事集二部僧，問旃荼修摩那：「汝實爾不？」答言：「實爾。世尊！」佛種種訶責已，告諸比丘：「今為諸比丘尼結戒，從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
When the senior bhikkhunīs heard it, they criticized her teacher: “Why do you instruct your student to accept food from a man who has defiled attachment in his mind?” When they had criticized her in all kinds of ways, they told the Buddha of this matter. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter and asked Chandasumanā: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” When the Buddha had criticized her in all kinds of ways, he told the bhikkhus: “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，教他比丘尼作是語：『汝但莫生染著，受染著男子飲食何苦？』是比丘尼初犯僧伽婆尸沙，可悔過。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī instructs another bhikkhunī: “Just don’t give rise to defiled attachment. Then what harm is there in accepting food and drinks from a man who has defiled attachment?”, that bhikkhunī commits an immediate saṅghādisesa, from which one can repent.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>若作此教，語語僧伽婆尸沙。</lzh>
If she gives such an instruction, each word is a saṅghādisesa.

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼，突吉羅。</lzh>
For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.
