<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼，與懷妊女受具足戒，入村乞食，諸白衣見，戲弄言：「此比丘尼擔重擔，應速與食！」或有言：「且觀其腹！」或有言：「此等不修梵行！」或有言：「此修梵行，是未出家時事。」便訶責諸比丘尼言：「何不待產竟，然後出家？以此毀辱梵行！諸比丘尼不知可度、不可度，無沙門行！破沙門法！」諸長老比丘尼聞，種種訶責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs gave the full ordination to pregnant women. They entered the village on almsround and when the lay people saw them, they laughed at them and said: “These bhikkhunīs carry a heavy load, we should quickly give food.” Some said: “Just look at their bellies.” Others said: “They don’t observe celibacy.” And still others said: “They observe celibacy. This is a matter from the time before they went forth.” Then they criticized the bhikkhunīs: “Why didn’t you wait until you had given birth, and then go forth? By this, you’re disgracing the monastic life. The bhikkhunīs don’t know who is ordainable and who isn’t. This isn’t the practice of renunciates. They’ve broken the rules of renunciates.” When the senior bhikkhunīs heard it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，與懷妊女受具足戒，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī gives the full ordination to a pregnant woman, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>發心，乃至白四羯磨竟，皆如上說。</lzh>
If she thinks about it, … when the formal act with a motion as fourth is finished, all is as explained above.

<lzh>若欲與受具足戒，應先看乳，若無兒相，不犯。</lzh>
If she wants to give the full ordination, she should first look at her breasts. If there’s no sign of a baby, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>若受戒竟，方知懷妊，亦不犯。</lzh>
If she only finds out that (the other) is pregnant after the ordination is finished, the offense also isn’t committed.
