<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時差摩比丘尼到舍衛城，在露地布薩，為風雨、塵土、蚊虻所惱。舊住比丘尼語一居士言：「今比丘尼僧露地布薩，有如是如是惱。如佛所說，若施僧堂舍最為第一。善哉，居士！可為僧作布薩堂！」答言：「我多事不得自作，今以此物付阿姨，可共料理。作竟語我，我當自往施僧！」諸比丘尼既得物已，共作是議：「我等衣服弊壞，可分此物各用作之，兼御露地布薩之惱。」議已，便分作衣。作衣竟，語居士言：「汝宜應歡喜！諸比丘尼衣服弊壞，汝所與物分用作衣，作衣已竟！」居士聞已，便譏訶言：「我不歡喜！何以故？前云作布薩堂最為第一，而今云何持用作衣？」</lzh>
At that time, Khemā bhikkhunī arrived in Sāvatthī and did the uposatha outdoors. She was troubled by wind and rain, dirty ground, and mosquitos and gadflies. The bhikkhunīs who had lived there for a long time told a householder: “Now the bhikkhunī sangha does the uposatha outdoors and is troubled by such and such things. According to what the Buddha said, offering the sangha a hall is the most excellent deed. It’d be good, householder, if you built an uposatha hall for the sangha.” They answered: “I’m very busy and am not able to build it myself. I now hand these items over to the venerables. Please arrange it together. When it has been built, tell me, and I’ll go myself to offer it to the sangha.” When the bhikkhunīs had obtained these items, they said to each other: “Our robes are worn out and breaking up. We can distribute these items and everyone uses them to make (robes). This will simultaneously ward off the troubles of doing the uposatha outdoors.” Having said that, they distributed them and made robes. When the robes were finished, they told the householder: “You should rejoice! The bhikkhunīs’ robes were worn out and breaking up. We distributed the items you gave, and used them to make robes. The making of robes is finished.” When the householder heard this, they criticized them: “I don’t rejoice! Why? Previously you said that building an uposatha hall was the most excellent deed, so why did you now take (my items) and use them to make robes?”
<lzh>諸長老比丘尼聞，種種訶責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
When the senior bhikkhunīs heard it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，為僧、為是事，從一居士乞；而餘用者，尼薩耆波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī asks for something for the sangha from a householder, and then uses it for another purpose, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.’”

<lzh>若發心欲分，及方便，皆突吉羅。</lzh>
If the wish to distribute arises in her mind, and if she plans it, both cases are dukkaṭas.

<lzh>是物應捨與僧，不得捨與一、二、三比丘尼。</lzh>
This item should be relinquished to the sangha. It may not be relinquished to one, two, or three bhikkhunīs.

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼，突吉羅。</lzh>
For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>若雖為是事乞，檀越後自令作餘用，不犯。</lzh>
Even if she has asked for one thing, if the supporter later themselves makes her use it for another purpose, the offense isn’t committed.
