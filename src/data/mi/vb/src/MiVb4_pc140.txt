<h2>First Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘問諸比丘尼：「某甲家在何處？」「此路向何處？」諸比丘尼輕慢不答，諸比丘瞋嫌，不復教誡，便愚闇無知不能學戒。諸長老比丘尼聞，種種訶責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhus asked the bhikkhunīs: “Where is the house of So-and-so?”, “where does this road go to?” The bhikkhunīs treated them with disdain and didn’t answer. The bhikkhus got angry and didn’t instruct them anymore. Then they were ignorant and without knowledge, and weren’t able to train in the precepts. When the senior bhikkhunīs heard it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Preliminary Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，比丘問，不答，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī, when asked by a bhikkhu, doesn’t answer, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Second Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>時六群比丘作麁惡語問比丘尼，比丘尼雖答，而懷羞恥，以事白佛。佛以是事集二部僧，告諸比丘：「今聽諸比丘尼，若比丘如法問，應答。從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
Then the group-of-six bhikkhus asked a bhikkhunī with coarse, unwholesome words. Even though the bhikkhunī answered, she felt ashamed and told the Buddha of this matter. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter and told the bhikkhus: “Now I allow that the bhikkhunīs answer if a bhikkhu asks according to dhamma. From now on, this precept should be recited thus:


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，若比丘如法問，不答，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī, when asked by a bhikkhu according to dhamma, doesn’t answer, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼，突吉羅。</lzh>
For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>若先相嫌，不共語，不答，不犯。</lzh>
If they earlier disliked each other, didn’t talk with each other, and she doesn’t answer, the offense isn’t committed.
