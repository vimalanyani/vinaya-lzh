<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼，於比丘尼僧中授弟子具足戒，經宿然後就比丘僧受戒。受戒人於一宿中得遮受戒病，比丘僧不復與受。諸長老比丘尼聞，種種呵責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs gave the full ordination to students in the bhikkhunī sangha, let the night pass, and only then the bhikkhu sangha gave the ordination. During the night, the candidates became sick with diseases that obstruct the ordination, and the bhikkhu sangha didn’t give it anymore. When the senior bhikkhunīs heard it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，異宿與弟子受具足戒，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī gives the full ordination to a student spread out over two days, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>從發心，乃至明相未出，突吉羅。明相出，和尚，波逸提；餘師僧，突吉羅。</lzh>
From when she thinks about it up to when it’s not dawn yet, it’s a dukkaṭa. At dawn, it’s a pācittiya for the preceptor. For the other teachers and the sangha, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>若僧不和集，及八難起，不犯。</lzh>
If the sangha doesn’t gather in harmony, or if the eight difficulties arise, the offense isn’t committed.
