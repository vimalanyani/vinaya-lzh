<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼畜髮，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs kept their hair. … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，畜髮，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī keeps her hair, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼髮長，波逸提。</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī has long hair, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼，畜髮及髮長不剃，突吉羅。</lzh>
If a sikkhamānā or a sāmaṇerī keeps her hair, and when the hair is long, doesn’t shave, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>半月一剃；過此，名為髮長。</lzh>
She should shave once every half-month. If she exceeds this, it’s called “long hair”.

<lzh>若無人剃及強力所逼不得剃，皆不犯。</lzh>
If there’s nobody to shave it, or if she’s forced not to shave, the offense isn’t committed.
