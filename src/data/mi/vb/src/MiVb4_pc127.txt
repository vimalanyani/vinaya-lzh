<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼度負債女人，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，皆如上度屬人婦女中說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs ordained women in debt. … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, all as explained above in ‘ordaining a female bondservant’. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，度負債女人，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī ordains a woman in debt, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>發心，乃至白四羯磨竟，亦如上說。</lzh>
If she thinks about it, … when the formal act with a motion as fourth is finished, also as explained above.

<lzh>若言：「出家竟，然後還債。」度此人，不犯。</lzh>
If (the candidate) says: “After I’ve gone forth, I’ll repay the debt,” and she ordains her, the offense isn’t committed.
