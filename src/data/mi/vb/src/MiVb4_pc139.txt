<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼於有食家宿，聞彼夫婦交會時聲，生愛欲心，不復樂道，遂有反俗、作外道者。諸長老比丘尼聞，種種訶責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs stayed overnight in families that were “eating”. They heard the sounds when the husband and wife had sexual intercourse, and sexual desire arose in their minds. They were no longer happy on the path and thereupon returned to lay life, or became non-Buddhist renunciates. When the senior bhikkhunīs heard it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，於有食家宿，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī stays overnight in a family that’s “eating”, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>有食者：有男女情相食入。</lzh>
“That’s eating” means there’s a man and a woman who have feelings for each other, and “eat” and penetrate each other.

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼，突吉羅。</lzh>
For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>若病須宿，及諸難起，皆不犯。</lzh>
If she’s sick and needs to stay overnight, or if difficulties arise, in all cases the offense isn’t committed.
