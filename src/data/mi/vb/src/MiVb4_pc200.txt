<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼莊嚴女人，便生不樂道心，遂致反俗、作外道者。諸白衣譏呵言：「云何比丘尼莊嚴女人，如莊母耶？與自莊嚴有何等異？不念行道，但作邪飾，無沙門行，破沙門法！」諸長老比丘尼聞，種種呵責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs adorned women. Then unhappiness about the path arose in their minds. Thereupon, they returned to lay life, or became non-Buddhist renunciates. The lay people criticized them: “Why do the bhikkhunīs adorn women, like beauticians? What’s the difference to adorning themselves? They don’t think about practising the path, they just make wrong ornaments. This isn’t the practice of renunciates. They’ve broken the rules of renunciates.” When the senior bhikkhunīs heard it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，莊嚴女人，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī adorns a woman, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>莊嚴者：為其梳頭，乃至插一華，著一釧，一一波逸提。</lzh>
“Adorning” means combing her hair, or even just sticking in one flower, or putting on one bracelet. Each is a pācittiya.

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼，突吉羅。</lzh>
For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.
