<h2>First Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸釋共作是要：「我等不與庶姓婚姻，若有犯者當重罪之！」時釋種黑離車女喪夫，夫弟欲取為婦，彼女不從，如是三返，誓不相許，便作是念：「彼女必有外通意，我當殺之！」便託為兄作會，語言：「為汝夫作會，汝來行香！」彼女便往到已，飲酒令醉，共行不淨，然後以爪摑傷其肉，告官司言：「黑離車女是我婦，今與外人私通！」官即遣收。彼女醉醒，自見身體處處傷破，作是念：「此人必當見殺！」便叛走向舍衛城，到比丘尼所出家學道。官收不得，知向舍衛城，便作移書與波斯匿王言：「我國女人犯罪應死，叛入彼國可送還我！若彼有罪人叛來我國，亦當送之。」</lzh>
At that time, the Sakyans had made this promise to each other: “We won’t inter-marry with the other clans. If someone commits this crime, we’ll give them a heavy punishment.” Then among the Sakyans, the husband of the Licchavi woman Kālī passed away, and the husband’s younger brother wanted to take her as his wife. The woman didn’t agree. He proposed three times, but she didn’t give him the marriage vows. Then he thought: “That woman must have the intention to have an affair. I’ll kill her.” Then on the pretext of holding a (memorial) service on behalf of his older brother, he said: “I’m holding a service for your husband. Come to burn incense!” When the woman had arrived there, (he made her) drink alcohol to make her drunk, and they engaged in sexual intercourse together. Then he scratched her flesh with his nails and injured her, and told the government official: “Kālī the Licchavi woman is my wife. Now she has an affair with another person.” The official then sent out someone to arrest her. When the woman soberec up, she saw that her body was injured and wounded everywhere and thought: “This man must want to see me killed.” Then she fled to Sāvatthī, went to the bhikkhunīs and went forth to train in the path. When the offical was unable to arrest her, he got to know that she was in Sāvatthī. Then he sent a letter to king Pasenadi and said: “A woman in my country has committed a crime and should die. She has fled to your country. Please send her back to me. If a criminal flees to my country, I’ll also send them back.”
<lzh>時波斯匿王即問左右：「有此女人入我國不？」答言：「有！諸比丘尼已度為道。王先有令：若我國內有犯比丘、比丘尼者，當與重罪。今已出家，無敢毀辱者。」王便報移書言：「實有此女來入我國，今已出家，不可追罪。若有餘事，敬如來示！」諸釋便譏訶言：「凡有此罪，不復得治，亂我國矣！諸比丘尼無復可度、不可度者，何道之有？無沙門行，破沙門法！」諸長老比丘尼聞，種種訶責，以事白佛。佛以是事集二部僧，問諸比丘尼：「汝等實爾不？」答言：「實爾。世尊！」佛種種訶責已，告諸比丘，今為諸比丘尼結戒，從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
Then king Pasenadi asked his ministers: “Has this woman entered my country?” They answered: “Yes. The bhikkhunīs have ordained her into the path.” The king had previously decreed: “If there’s a criminal bhikkhu or bhikkhunī in my country, I’ll give a heavy punishment.” Now that she had gone forth, he didn’t dare to take action against her. The king then sent a letter back and said: “It’s true that this woman has entered my country. Now she has gone forth and I can’t prosecute her for the crime. If you have another issue, respectfully bring it to the Tathāgata’s attention.” The Sakyans then criticized it: “We won’t be able to punish anyone who commits this crime anymore. It’ll really disturb our country. The bhikkhunīs don’t even (know)<note>I follow the parallel passage in pācittiya 116 for my translation: 諸比丘尼不知可度、不可度, which includes 知, “know”. Otherwise, this sentence is hard to make sense of.</note> who is ordainable and who isn’t. What kind of path could they have? This isn’t the practice of renunciates. They’ve broken the rules of renunciates.” When the senior bhikkhunīs heard it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, and told the Buddha of this matter. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter and asked the bhikkhunīs: “Did you really do this?” They answered: “We really did this, World-honored One.” When the Buddha had criticized them in all kinds of ways, he told the bhikkhus: “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>First Preliminary Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，知有罪女，度為比丘尼者，是比丘尼初犯僧伽婆尸沙，可悔過。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī knows that a woman has committed a crime and ordains her as a bhikkhunī, that bhikkhunī commits an immediate saṅghādisesa, from which one can repent.’”


<h2>Second Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>復有諸賊女、偷女、應死女，諸居士言：「若能出家，我當活汝！」便求出家，即白諸比丘尼：「願見度脫！」諸比丘尼言：「佛未聽我等度如汝輩。」以事白佛，佛以是事集二部僧，告諸比丘：「若主聽者，聽比丘尼度之。從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
There were also female criminals, female thieves, and women who should die, and the householders said: “If you’re able to go forth, we’ll spare your lives.” Then they asked for the going forth, and told the bhikkhunīs: “Please see to our ordination to save us.” The bhikkhunīs said: “The Buddha hasn’t allowed us to ordain people such as you yet.” They told the Buddha of this matter. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter and told the bhikkhus: “If the ruler allows it, I allow the bhikkhunīs to ordain them. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Second Preliminary Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，知有罪女，主不聽，而度者，是比丘尼初犯僧伽婆尸沙，可悔過。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī knows that a woman has committed a crime, and that the ruler doesn’t allow it, but ordains her, that bhikkhunī commits an immediate saṅghādisesa, from which one can repent.’”


<h2>Third Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>復有犯罪女，不得於佛法出家，便入外道。諸居士後見，有言：「此是我等犯罪女，當奪其外道衣服！」或有言：「外道出家已是重罰，自可宜去！」即便放之。此諸女等，後來投諸比丘尼，作是言：「姊妹！我等本非不敬信佛法，於外道出家。諸姊妹不肯見度，逼不獲已，入外道耳！我等所畏，今已見聽出家，願見愍度！」諸比丘尼不知云何？以是白佛。佛以是事集二部僧，告諸比丘：「若有罪女先已出家，今聽度之！從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
There were also women who had committed a crime and who didn’t obtain the going forth in the Buddha’s dhamma. Then they entered a non-Buddhist sect. When the householders later saw them, some said: “These are our women who have committed a crime. We’ll snatch their non-Buddhist robes.” Some said: “Having gone forth in a non-Buddhist sect is a heavy punishment. Let them go.” Then they released them. These women later came to the bhikkhunīs seeking refuge and said: “Sisters, it’s not because we originally didn’t have respect and faith in the Buddha’s dhamma, that we’ve gone forth in a non-Buddhist sect. The sisters refused to see to our ordination. Under the thread of being captured, we entered a non-Buddhist sect. Out of fear, we’ve now seen to it to be allowed to go forth. Please see to our ordination out of compassion.” The bhikkhunīs didn’t know what to do. They told the Buddha of this. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter and told the bhikkhus: “If there are women who have committed a crime and have earlier already gone forth, I allow to ordain them. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，知有罪女，主不聽度為道，除先出家。是比丘尼初犯僧伽婆尸沙，可悔過。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī knows that a woman has committed a crime and that the ruler doesn’t allow it, and ordains her into the path, unless she has gone forth before, that bhikkhunī commits an immediate saṅghādisesa, from which one can repent.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>有罪者：若犯姦，若偷盜，是名有罪。</lzh>
“Having committed a crime” means she has committed adultery or a theft. This is called “having committed a crime”.

<lzh>主者：殺活所由，是名為主。</lzh>
“A ruler” means the one who allows to take her life. This is called “the ruler”.

<lzh>若比丘尼，發心度此女，及方便乃至集僧，三羯磨未竟，皆突吉羅。三羯磨竟，和尚，僧伽婆尸沙；餘尼師僧，皆偷羅遮。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī thinks about ordaining that woman, if she plans it, up to when she gathers the sangha, if the three announcements aren’t finished yet, each is a dukkaṭa. When the three announcements are finished, it’s a saṅghādisesa for the preceptor. For the other bhikkhunī teachers and the sangha, it’s a thullaccaya each.
