<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼度長病女人，不堪學戒，愚闇無知。諸長老比丘尼見，種種訶責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs ordained chronically ill women. They couldn’t bear to train in the precepts, and were ignorant and without knowledge. When the senior bhikkhunīs saw it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，度長病女人，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī ordains a woman who is chronically ill, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>長病者：長患寒熱，發作有常。</lzh>
“Chronically ill” means she suffers for a long time from heat and cold, and it appears to be permanent.

<lzh>發心，乃至白四羯磨竟，亦如上說。</lzh>
If she thinks about it, … when the formal act with a motion as fourth is finished, also as explained above.

<lzh>若受戒後，得此病，不犯。</lzh>
If she contracts this disease after she has received the precepts, the offense isn’t committed.
