<h2>Origin Stories</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼中前、中後噉生熟蒜，若空噉、若合食噉，房舍臭處。諸居士來看，聞蒜臭，譏訶言：「正似白衣家作食處！」</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs ate fresh and cooked garlic in the mornings and afternoons, either by itself or together with other food, and the building became smelly. When the householders came and saw it, and smelled the garlic stench, they criticized them: “It’s really like the kitchen of a lay house.”

<lzh>復有諸比丘尼至長者家，長者聞噉蒜臭，便語言：「阿姨遠去，口中蒜臭！」諸比丘尼羞恥。</lzh>
There were also bhikkhunīs who went to a householder’s home. The householder smelled the stench of them eating garlic, and said: “Venerables, go back. Your mouths are reeking of garlic.” The bhikkhunīs were ashamed.

<lzh>復有一賣蒜人，請諸比丘尼與蒜，以此致貧，飲食不繼。家人語言：「若不能與我食，放我令去！汝自長與比丘尼作奴！」隣人聞之，訶言：「汝家自無食，何豫諸比丘尼？」具以事答。有不信樂佛法者語言：「由汝親近比丘尼故，致如此苦。若復親近，方當劇是！此等出家本求解脫，而今貪著美味！無沙門行，破沙門法！」諸長老比丘尼聞種種訶責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
There was also a garlic vendor who invited the bhikkhunīs and gave garlic. Because of this, they became poor and had no more drinks and food. Their slaves said: “If you can’t give us food, release us and let us go. You’ve made yourself a slave to the bhikkhunīs for a long time.” When the neighbors heard this, they criticized them: “Your own family has no food, why do you share it with the bhikkhunīs?” They explained this matter in full. There were those without joyous faith in the Buddha’s dhamma who said: “Because you were friendly with the bhikkhunīs, such suffering has come to you. If you keep on being friendly, it’ll become even tougher than this. These renunciates originally sought liberation, and now they crave for delicious tastes. This isn’t the practice of renunciates. They’ve broken the rules of renunciates.” When the senior bhikkhunīs heard it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh> 
「若比丘尼，噉蒜，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī eats garlic, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>若噉生蒜，咽咽波逸提；噉熟蒜，突吉羅。</lzh>
If she eats fresh garlic, each each mouthful is a pācittiya. If she eats cooked garlic, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼，突吉羅。</lzh>
For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>若病時噉，強力伏令噉，不犯。</lzh>
If she eats it when she’s sick, or when she’s overpowered by force and made to eat it, the offense isn’t committed.
