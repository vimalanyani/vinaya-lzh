<h2>First Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時有一估客喪婦，作是念：「我今當於何處求索好婦？」時旃茶修摩那比丘尼，有弟子名修摩，色貌殊特，彼見生染著心，作是念：「以食誘之，或可得果。」便語言：「汝若須酥、油、蜜、石蜜、蒲闍尼、佉闍尼，皆從我取。」彼比丘尼即便往取。既相狎習，便問比丘尼言：「汝知我與汝食意不？」答言：「汝為求福故，與我食。」彼言：「不以此事！我喪失婦，見汝清修，甚相貪樂，能降意不？」答言：「不能！」其人復言：「與我作婦，當以奇珍相與，衣服極麗，飲食隨時，要令無乏。」亦答如初。</lzh>
At that time, there was a merchant whose wife had passed away. He thought: “Where will I now ask for a good wife?” Then Chandasumanā bhikkhunī had a student called Sumā whose was outstandingly beautiful. When he saw her, defiled attachment arose in his mind and he thought: “If I tempt her with food, I might attain my goal.” Then he said: “If you need ghee, oil, honey, sugar, non-staple or staple food, take everything from me.” That bhikkhunī then went and took it. When they had become familiar with each other, he asked the bhikkhunī: “Do you know my intention for giving you food?” She answered: “Because you’re seeking merit, you give me food.” He said: “It’s not like this! I’ve lost my wife. I saw your pure practice, and profoundly craved for and delighted in you. Can you submit to my intention?” She answered: “I can’t!” That man added: “If you become my wife, I’ll give you treasures, the most elegant clothes, food and drinks at the appropriate time, and I promise that you’ll lack nothing.” She answered again as before.
<lzh>餘估客見，便助迫脇言：「汝若不欲為他作婦，何故受他飲食？若必不能，當奪汝衣鉢！」或復有言：「速遣令去，勿使人聞！若王得知，必重治我等！」諸居士聞，譏呵言：「云何比丘尼受他染著男子飲食？此輩無沙門行，破沙門法！」諸長老比丘尼聞，種種訶責，以事白佛。佛以是事集二部僧，問修摩比丘尼：「汝實爾不？」答言：「實爾。世尊！」佛種種訶責已，告諸比丘：「今為諸比丘尼結戒，從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
When the other merchants saw it, they helped him to hold down her flanks, and said: “If you didn’t want to become his wife, why did you accept his food and drinks? If you really can’t do it, we’ll snatch your robes and bowl.” There were also some who said: “Quickly let her go and don’t let people hear this. If the king gets to know this, he’ll certainly punish us heavily.” When the householders heard this, they criticized her: “Why does a bhikkhunī accept food and drinks from a man with defiled attachment? These people don’t have the practice of renunciates. They’ve broken the rules of renunciates.” When the senior bhikkhunīs heard it, they criticized her in all kinds of ways, and told the Buddha of this matter. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter and asked Sumā bhikkhunī: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” When the Buddha had criticized her in all kinds of ways, he told the bhikkhus: “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>First Preliminary Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，受他染著心男子飲食，是比丘尼初犯僧伽婆尸沙，可悔過。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī accepts food and drinks from a man, who has defiled attachment in his mind, that bhikkhunī commits an immediate saṅghādisesa, from which one can repent.’”


<h2>Second Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>有諸男子請比丘尼前食後食，於中生染著心。諸比丘尼知不敢受，以事白佛。佛以是事集二部僧，告諸比丘：「若比丘尼無染著心，受他染著心男子飲食，犯僧伽婆尸沙，無有是處。從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
There were men who invited the bhikkhunīs for breakfast and lunch, and in between defiled attachment arose in their minds. The bhikkhunīs knew about it and didn’t dare to accept. They told the Buddha of this matter. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter and told the bhikkhus: “It’s not possible that a bhikkhunī who doesn’t have defiled attachment in her mind and accepts food and drinks from a man who has defiled attachment in his mind, commits a saṅghādisesa. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Second Preliminary Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，有染著心，受他染著心男子飲食，是比丘尼初犯僧伽婆尸沙，可悔過。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī, who has defiled attachment in her mind, accepts food and drinks from a man, who has defiled attachment in his mind, that bhikkhunī commits an immediate saṅghādisesa, from which one can repent.’”


<h2>Third Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>復有一比丘尼有染著心，從一染著心男子受飲食，受已生疑：「我將無犯僧伽婆尸沙！」即持歸與餘比丘尼，餘比丘尼問：「此美飲食，汝何故不噉？」具以事答，餘比丘尼言：「汝所畏，我亦應畏！」以事白佛。佛以是事集二部僧，告諸比丘：「若比丘尼有染著心，自手受染著心男子食；不食而與他食，皆不犯。從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
There was also a bhikkhunī, who had defiled attachment in her mind, and accepted food and drinks from a man, who had defiled attachment in his mind. When she had accepted it, doubt arose: “I’d better not commit a saṅghādisesa!” Then she took it back and gave it to the other bhikkhunīs. The other bhikkhunīs asked her: “Why don’t you eat these delicious foods and drinks?” She explained this matter in full and the other bhikkhunīs said: “What you fear, we should also fear.” They told the Buddha of this matter. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter and told the bhikkhus: “If a bhikkhunī, who has defiled attachment in her mind, accepts food with her own hand from a man, who has defiled attachment in his mind, and if she doesn’t eat it and gives it to others to eat, nobody commits the offense. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼有染著心，自手受染著心男子食食，是比丘尼初犯僧伽婆尸沙，可悔過。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī, who has defiled attachment in her mind, accepts food with her own hand from a man who has defiled attachment in his mind, and eats it, that bhikkhunī commits an immediate saṅghādisesa, from which one can repent.’”

For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.
