<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼半月布薩，不來比丘僧中乞教誡師，以無人教誡故，愚闇無知不能學戒。諸長老比丘尼見，種種呵責，以事白佛。佛以是事集二部僧，問諸比丘尼：「汝等實爾不？」答言：「實爾。世尊！」佛種種訶責諸比丘尼：「我先不說八敬法，教汝等半月乞教誡師耶？」訶責已，告諸比丘：「今為諸比丘尼結戒，從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs, at the half-monthly uposatha, didn’t come to the bhikkhu sangha to ask for an instructor. Because nobody instructed them, they were ignorant and without knowledge, and weren’t able to train in the precepts. When the senior bhikkhunīs saw it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, and told the Buddha of the matter. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter and asked the bhikkhunīs: “Did you really do this?” They answered: “We really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized the bhikkhunīs in all kinds of ways: “Haven’t I already taught the eight rules of respect and taught you to ask for an instructor every half-month?” Having criticized them, he told the bhikkhus: “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus:


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，半月不於僧中乞教誡師，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī doesn’t ask for an instructor every half-month in the sangha, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼，不求教誡悔過，突吉羅。</lzh>
If a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī don’t seek instruction and confess transgressions, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>若請不得，若病，不犯。</lzh>
If she invites but doesn’t obtain (instruction), or if she’s sick, the offense isn’t committed.
