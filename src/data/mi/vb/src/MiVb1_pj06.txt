<h2>Origin Stories</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼，受男子捉手、捉衣、共期、獨共行、獨共住、獨共語、獨共一座坐、身親近男子，以此欲染心，不復樂道，或有反俗及作外道者。</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs let men hold their hands, and their robes, made appointments, walked with them alone, stood with them alone, talked with them alone, sat with them alone on one seat, and brought their bodies close to the men. From this, desire defiled their minds, and they were no longer happy on the path. There were some who returned to lay life, and some became non-Buddhist renunciates.

<lzh>時偷羅難陀比丘尼，著新染衣，摩拭身體，畫治眉目，往多人處。有諸男子捉其手，捉其衣言：「汝手柔軟好，汝衣細滑好！」諸長老比丘尼見，種種呵責，以事白佛。佛以是事集二部僧，問諸比丘尼：「汝等實作上八法不？」答言：「實爾。世尊！」佛種種呵責已，告諸比丘：「今為諸比丘尼結戒，從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
Then Thullanandā bhikkhunī put on a newly dyed robe, rubbed her body, put makeup on her eyebrows and eyes, and went to a crowded place. There were men who held her hands and robes and said: “Your hands are soft and nice, your robes are fine and smooth.” When the senior bhikkhunīs saw it, they criticized her in all kinds of ways, and told the Buddha of this matter. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter and asked the bhikkhunīs: “Did you really do these above eight things?” They answered: “We really did them, World-honored One.” When the Buddha had criticized them in all kinds of ways, he told the bhikkhus: “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus:

<h2>Final Ruling</h2></h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，欲盛變心，受男子捉手、捉衣、共期、獨共行、獨共住、獨共語、獨共一座坐、身親近男子。八法具者，是比丘尼得波羅夷，不共住。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī, in a mindstate altered by abundant desire, lets a man hold her hand, hold her robe, makes an appointment with him, walks with him alone, stands with him alone, talks with him alone, sits with him alone on one seat, or brings her body close to the man, completing these eight things, that bhikkhunī incurs a pārājika, and doesn’t live in community.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>捉手者：從肘已前。</lzh>
“Holding her hand” means before the elbow.

<lzh>捉衣者：身所著衣。</lzh>
“Holding her robe” means the robes she wears on her body.

<lzh>共期者：期至某處行婬法、或摩觸身，往到彼。</lzh>
“Makes an appointment with him” means setting a time to go to a certain place to engage in sexual intercourse, or to rub and touch their bodies, and then going there.

<lzh>獨共行者：獨共男子一道行。</lzh>
“Walking with him alone” means walking on a path alone with a man.

<lzh>獨共住者：獨共男子一處住。</lzh>
“Standing with him alone” means standing in a place alone with a man.

<lzh>獨共語者：獨共男子一處語。</lzh>
“Talking with him alone” means talking in a place alone with a man.

<lzh>獨共一座坐者：獨共男子一床上坐。</lzh>
“Sitting with him alone on one seat” means sitting on one bench alone with a man.

<lzh>身親近男子者：共一座坐時，身轉就男子。</lzh>
“Bringing her body close to the man” means when they’re sitting together on one seat, her body turns and comes close to the man’s.

<lzh>若犯捉手，乃至身轉就男子，一一皆偷羅遮；若犯七事，雖已隨悔，後犯一事滿八，亦成波羅夷。</lzh>
If she commits the hand-holding, … the body coming close to the man’s, each is a thullaccaya. If she commits seven things, even if she has already confessed them, and later commits the one thing that completes the eight, she fulfills the pārājika.

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼，突吉羅。</lzh>
For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.
