<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼度婬女，不受教誡。譬如窈領牛不堪駕車，若駕車時但欲出轅。諸長老比丘尼種種訶責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs ordained prostitutes who didn’t accept instruction, like an ox with a tight collar can’t endure to draw a cart, and while he’s drawing a cart only wants to get away from the cart’s shafts. The senior bhikkhunīs criticized them in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，度婬女，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī ordains a prostitute, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>發心，乃至白四羯磨未竟，突吉羅。白四羯磨竟，和尚，波逸提；餘尼師眾，突吉羅。</lzh>
If she thinks about it, up to when the formal act with a motion as fourth isn’t finished yet, it’s a dukkaṭa. If the formal act with a motion as fourth is finished, it’s a pācittiya for the preceptor. For the other bhikkhunī teachers and the sangha, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>彼厭惡女身，度之，不犯。</lzh>
If she’s disgusted with her female body, and (the bhikkhunī) ordains her, the offense isn’t committed.
