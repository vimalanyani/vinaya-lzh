<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時修休摩比丘尼、婆頗比丘尼，常共行止，後婆頗命過，修休摩為之悲泣。諸比丘尼語言：「汝莫如是！一切有為，悉皆磨滅；如佛所說，恩愛別離，無長存者。若有為法不壞、不散，無有是處！」修休摩言：「我今不復為其啼哭！何以故？彼生時，不修梵行！」諸比丘尼問言：「汝云何知？」答言：「彼與我共行，親見與男子行婬欲事。」諸比丘尼訶責言：「汝云何生時覆藏其罪，死乃發露？」諸長老比丘尼種種訶責，以事白佛。佛以是事集二部僧，問修休摩：「汝實爾不？」答言：「實爾。世尊！」佛種種呵責已，告諸比丘：「今為諸比丘尼結戒，從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs Xiuxiumo and Popo often spent time together. Later, Popo passed away, and Xiuxiumo grieved and wept because of this. The bhikkhunīs said: “Don’t act like this. Everything that exists will be obliterated. According to what the Buddha said, there’s separation from what we like. It won’t exist for long. There’s nothing that doesn’t have the nature to be destroyed and scattered.” Xiuxiumo said: “Now I won’t cry for her anymore. Why? When she was alive, she didn’t practise celibacy.” The bhikkhunīs asked: “How do you know?” She answered: “She and I often spent time together. I saw for myself that she engaged in sexual intercourse with a man.” The bhikkhunīs criticized her: “Why did you conceal her offense when she was alive, but disclose it after she died?” The senior bhikkhunīs criticized her in all kinds of ways, and told the Buddha of this matter. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter and asked Xiuxiumo: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” When the Buddha had criticized her in all kinds of ways, he told the bhikkhus: “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus:

<h2>Final Ruling</h2></h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，見比丘尼犯波羅夷，覆藏。彼比丘尼後時，若在、若死、若遠行、若被擯、若罷道、若形變，作是語：『我先親見其犯波羅夷。』是比丘尼得波羅夷，不共住。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī sees that another bhikkhunī commits a pārājika, and conceals it, and if, when that other bhikkhunī later stays on, dies, wanders far away, is expelled, disrobes, or joins non-Buddhist renunciates, the first bhikkhunī says: “I earlier saw for myself that she committed a pārājika,” that bhikkhunī incurs a pārājika, and doesn’t live in community.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>覆藏：從晨朝至初夜初分，時時皆突吉羅；從初夜初分至明相未出，時時皆偷羅遮；至明相出，波羅夷。</lzh>
“Concealing” means from dawn to the first part of the first night, each time period is a dukkaṭa. From the first part of the first night to before dawn, each time period is a thullaccaya. At dawn, it’s a pārājika.

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼，突吉羅。</lzh>
For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>若欲說，而無比丘尼未得說；若入大捨定，及八難起，皆不犯。</lzh>
If she wants to tell, but there’s no bhikkhunī and she’s not able to tell yet, if she enters the great equanimous concentration, and if the eight difficulties arise, in all cases the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>八難者：一、病；二、王；三、賊；四、水；五、火；六、衣鉢；七、命；八、梵行(八重法竟)。</lzh>
“The eight difficulties” means: 1) Sickness, 2) Kings, 3) Criminals, 4) Water, 5) Fire, 6) Robes and bowl, 7) Life, 8) Celibacy. (End of the eight grave offenses.)
