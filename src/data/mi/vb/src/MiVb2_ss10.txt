<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>優波離又問：「世尊已為諸比丘結戒：『若比丘，為破和合僧懃方便，乃至僧伽婆尸沙。』我當云何持？」佛言：「當作二部僧持。從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
Upāli asked again: “The World-honored One has laid down the precept for the bhikkhus: ‘If a bhikkhu strives with skillful means to split the sangha in harmony … it’s a saṅghādisesa.’ How should I remember this?” The Buddha said: “You should remember it as to be practised by both sanghas. From now on, this precept should be recited thus:


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，為破和合僧懃方便，諸比丘尼語是比丘尼：『汝莫為破和合僧懃方便，當與僧和合，僧和合故，歡喜無諍，一心一學，如水乳合，共弘師教，安樂行。』如是諫，堅持不捨，應第二、第三諫。第二、第三諫，捨是事善；不捨者，是比丘尼三諫，犯僧伽婆尸沙，可悔過。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī strives with skillful means to split the sangha in harmony, the bhikkhunīs should say to her: “Don’t strive with skillful means to split the sangha in harmony. You should be in harmony with the sangha. Because a sangha is in harmony, they’re happy, don’t quarrel, they’re of one mind and one training, mixing like water and milk, spreading the master’s teaching together, and living comfortably.” If she, when admonished like this, holds firmly on to it and doesn’t give it up, they should admonish her a second and a third time. If she gives up this matter at the second or third admonishment, it’s fine. If not, that bhikkhunī commits a saṅghādisesa after three admonishments, from which one can repent.’”
