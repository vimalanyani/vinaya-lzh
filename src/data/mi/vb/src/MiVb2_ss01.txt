<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時長老優波離問佛：「世尊已為諸比丘結戒：『若比丘行媒法，乃至一交會，僧伽婆尸沙。』我當云何持？」佛言：「應作二部僧持。從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, the venerable Upāli asked the Buddha: “The World-honored One has laid down the precept for the bhikkhus: ‘If a bhikkhu engages in matchmaking, … a one-night-stand, it’s a saṅghādisesa.’ How should I remember this?” The Buddha said: “You should remember it as to be practised by both sanghas. From now on, this precept should be recited thus:


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，行媒法，若為私通事，持男意至女邊，持女意至男邊，乃至一交會。是比丘尼初犯僧伽婆尸沙，可悔過。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī engages in matchmaking, even for an affair, and delivers a man’s intentions to a woman, or a woman’s intentions to a man, even just for a one-night-stand, that bhikkhunī commits an immediate saṅghādisesa, from which one can repent.’”
