<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時闡陀母名修摩那，為人惡性，時人遂號為旃荼修摩那；好共他鬪，僧斷其事，便言僧隨愛恚癡畏，諸比丘尼語言：「汝莫好共他鬪，莫作是語：『僧隨愛恚癡畏！』何以故？僧不隨愛恚癡畏。汝捨是語，於佛法中增廣，得安樂住！」如是諫，堅持不捨，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, Chandamātā’s name was Sumanā. She was of bad character towards others, and then people started to call her Chandasumanā. She often quarreled with others, and when the sangha had settled matters, she said: “The sangha follows desire, anger, delusion, and fear.” The bhikkhunīs said: “Don’t often quarrel with others, and don’t say: ‘The sangha follows desire, anger, delusion, and fear.’ Why? The sangha doesn’t follow desire, anger, delusion, and fear. Give up this speech. You’ll grow in the Buddha’s dhamma and live comfortably.” When she was admonished like this, she held firmly on to it and didn’t give it up. … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus:


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，好共他鬪，僧斷其事，便言僧隨愛恚癡畏，諸比丘尼語言：『汝莫好共他鬪，莫作是語：「僧隨愛恚癡畏。」何以故？僧不隨愛恚癡畏，汝等捨是語，於佛法中增廣，得安樂住！』如是諫，堅持不捨，應第二、第三諫。第二、第三諫，捨是事善；不捨者，是比丘尼三諫，犯僧伽婆尸沙，可悔過。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī often quarrels with others, and when the sangha has settled matters, says: “The sangha follows desire, anger, delusion, and fear,” the bhikkhunīs should say: “Don’t often quarrel with others, and don’t say: ‘The sangha follows desire, anger, delusion, and fear.’ Why? The sangha doesn’t follow desire, anger, delusion, and fear. Give up this speech. You’ll grow in the Buddha’s dhamma and live comfortably.” If she, when admonished like this, holds firmly on to it and doesn’t give it up, they should admonish her a second and a third time. If she gives up this matter at the second or third admonishment, it’s fine. If not, that bhikkhunī commits a saṅghādisesa after three admonishments, from which one can repent.’”
