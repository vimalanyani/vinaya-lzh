<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼與比丘獨屏處，共立、共語，生染著心，遂有反俗、作外道者。諸白衣見，作是言：「此比丘、比丘尼獨屏處，共立、共語，必說婬欲事！無沙門行，破沙門法！」諸長老比丘尼見聞，種種訶責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs stood and talked with bhikkhus alone in a secluded place, and defiled attachment arose in their minds. Thereupon they returned to lay life, or became non-Buddhist renunciates. When the lay people saw it, they said: “These bhikkhus and bhikkhunīs stand and talk alone in a secluded place, they must be speaking about sex. This isn’t the practice of renunciates. They’ve broken the rules of renunciates.” When the senior bhikkhunīs saw and heard it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，與比丘獨屏處，共立、共語，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī stands and talks with a bhikkhu alone in a secluded place, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼，突吉羅。</lzh>
For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>若眾多比丘尼，一比丘；若八難時，不犯。</lzh>
If there are many bhikkhunīs and one bhikkhu, or when there are the eight difficulties, the offense isn’t committed.
