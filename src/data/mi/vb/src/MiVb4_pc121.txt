<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼與弟子受具足戒已，不攝取、不教誡、不教誦習，愚闇無知不能學戒。諸長老比丘尼見，種種呵責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs gave the full ordination to students, and didn’t assist them, instruct them, and teach them to recite and study. They were ignorant and without knowledge, and unable to train in the precepts. When the senior bhikkhunīs saw it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，畜弟子六年中不自攝取，不教人攝取，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī takes on a student, and doesn’t assist her for six years herself, or instructs others to assist her, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>若弟子不受教，不犯。</lzh>
If the student doesn’t accept instruction, the offense isn’t committed.
