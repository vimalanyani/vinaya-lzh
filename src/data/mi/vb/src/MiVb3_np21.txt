<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時有一下坐比丘尼少於知識，得未成衣，不知作之，持至諸比丘尼所，語言：「我最下坐，少於知識，願為我作！」諸比丘尼言：「我事務多，不得為汝作！汝可至偷羅難陀所問之，彼多成衣，或與汝貿易。」彼比丘尼即持往問偷羅難陀，便以成衣易之。彼比丘尼得已，還到所住處。諸比丘尼問言：「汝得衣不？」答言：「得！」又問：「從誰得？」答言：「偷羅難陀！」諸比丘尼言：「取來共看！」便出衣示，諸比丘尼言：「此衣勝汝衣數倍，由來無人能得彼利，汝今忽得，甚為希有！」時偷羅難陀隔壁聞，便語彼比丘尼：「還我衣來，不與汝貿！」諸長老比丘尼聞，種種訶責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, there was a junior bhikkhunī with little knowledge who obtained a cloth that wasn’t made into a robe yet, and she didn’t know how to do it. She took it, went to the other bhikkhunīs, and said: “I’m the most junior and have little knowledge. Please do it for me.” The bhikkhunīs said: “We’re very busy and aren’t able to do it for you. Please go to Thullanandā and ask her, she has made many robes, maybe she’ll exchange one with you.” The bhikkhunī then took (the cloth), went and asked Thullanandā, and exchanged it for a finished robe. When the bhikkhunī had obtained it, she returned to her residence. The other bhikkhunīs asked her: “Did you obtain a robe?” She answered: “I did.” They asked again: “From whom did you obtain it?” She answered: “From Thullanandā.” The bhikkhunīs said: “Bring it so that we can have a look together.” She then took out the robe and showed it, and the bhikkhunīs said: “This robe is many times better than your cloth. Previously nobody could obtain such requisites, but now you’ve instantly obtained it. This is really hard to get!” Then Thullanandā, who was next door, heard it and said to the bhikkhunī: “Return my robe, I didn’t exchange it with you!”
When the senior bhikkhunīs heard it, they criticized her in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，與比丘尼貿衣，後悔還索，得者，尼薩耆波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī exchanges a robe with another bhikkhunī, and later regrets it and asks to have it returned, and if she obtains it, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼，突吉羅。</lzh>
For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>若兩悔；若得衣，不如本要，還取，不犯。</lzh>
If both regret it, or if she obtains a robe that isn’t as it was originally promised, and she takes the other back, the offense isn’t committed.
