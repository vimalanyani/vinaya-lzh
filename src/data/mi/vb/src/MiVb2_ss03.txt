<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>長老優波離又問佛：「世尊已為諸比丘結戒：『若比丘，自不如法，惡瞋故，於異分中取片、若似片，乃至僧伽婆尸沙。』我當云何持？」佛言：「應作二部僧持。從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
The venerable Upāli asked the Buddha again: “The World-honored One has laid down the precept for the bhikkhus: ‘If a bhikkhu himself doesn’t act according to dhamma, and because of unwholesome anger takes an aspect, or something similar to an aspect, of a different matter … it’s a saṅghādisesa.’ How should I remember this?” The Buddha said: “You should remember it as to be practised by both sanghas.

<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，自不如法，惡瞋故，於異分中取片、若似片，作波羅夷謗無波羅夷比丘尼，欲破彼梵行。是比丘尼後時，若問、若不問，言：『我是事異分中取片、若似片，住瞋故，謗是比丘尼。』初犯僧伽婆尸沙，可悔過。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī herself doesn’t act according to dhamma, and because of unwholesome anger takes an aspect, or something similar to an aspect, of a different matter and slanders a bhikkhunī, who hasn’t commited a pārājika, with a pārājika, wanting to destroy her monastic life, and if that bhikkhunī at a later time, whether questioned or not questioned, says: “I took an aspect, or something similar to an aspect, of a different matter, and slandered that bhikkhunī because I was harboring anger,” she commits an immediate saṅghādisesa, from which one can repent.’”
