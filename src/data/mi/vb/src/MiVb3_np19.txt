<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時偷羅難陀比丘尼從坐坫人乞鉢，彼即買鉢與之。既得，便言：「我不復須，可以酥見施。」即復與之，賣所買鉢。比坫人見，語言：「汝賣坫上物，不得活耶？乃復作販鉢人為？」答言：「偷羅難陀從我乞鉢，我買欲與，彼不復用，更從我乞酥，以酥與之，故賣此鉢耳！」諸人言：「乞人之法，應隨所乞取！何緣既得，不取，復索餘物？此輩常說，少欲知足，而今無厭。無沙門行！破沙門法！」諸長老比丘尼聞，種種訶責，以事白佛。佛以是事集二部僧，問偷羅難陀比丘尼：「汝實爾不？」答言：「實爾。世尊！」佛種種訶責已，告諸比丘：「今為諸比丘尼結戒，從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, Thullanandā bhikkhunī asked for a bowl from a vendor sitting at a stall. They then bought the bowl and gave it to her. When she had obtained it, she said: “I don’t need it anymore, please see to offering ghee.” They then also gave that, and sold the bowl they had bought. When the other vendors saw it, they said: “Aren’t you able to make a living by selling the goods on your stall? Are you now also a bowl trader?” They answered: “Thullanandā asked me for a bowl. I bought one and wanted to give it, but she didn’t use it anymore, and also asked me for ghee. I gave the ghee, and I just sell the bowl.” The people said: “According to the rules of mendicants, you should take what you’ve asked for. How can you not take something when you obtain it, and still ask for other things? These people always say that they’ve few wishes and know moderation, but now she has no limit. This isn’t the practice of renunciates. She has broken the rules of renunciates.”
When the senior bhikkhunīs heard it, they criticized her in all kinds of ways, and told the Buddha of this matter. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter and asked Thullanandā bhikkhunī: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” When the Buddha had criticized her in all kinds of ways, he told the bhikkhus: “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，先乞是，既得不用，更乞餘物，尼薩耆波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī first asks for one thing, and when she obtains it, doesn’t use it, and still asks for something else, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>隨更乞多少，一一尼薩耆波逸提。</lzh>
However many she still asks for, each item is a nissaggiya pācittiya.

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼，突吉羅。</lzh>
For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.
