<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼安居竟，不於比丘僧中請見聞疑罪，無人教誡，愚無所知，不能學戒。諸長老比丘尼種種訶責，以事白佛。佛以是事集二部僧，問諸比丘尼：「汝等實爾不？」答言：「實爾。世尊！」佛種種訶責言：「我先不說八敬法，比丘尼安居竟，應從比丘眾請見聞疑罪耶？」訶已，告諸比丘：「今為諸比丘尼結戒，從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, when the rains retreat had ended, the bhikkhunīs didn’t invite the bhikkhu sangha with regards to offenses seen, heard, or suspected. There was nobody instructing them, they were ignorant and without knowledge, and weren’t able train in the precepts. The senior bhikkhunīs criticized them in all kinds of ways, and told the Buddha of the matter. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter and asked the bhikkhunīs: “Did you really do this?” They answered: “We really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized them in all kinds of ways: “Haven’t I already taught the eight rules of respect: A bhikkhunī, when the rains retreat has ended, should invite the bhikkhu sangha with regards to offenses seen, heard, or suspected?” Having criticized them, he told the bhikkhus: “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus:


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，安居竟，不從比丘僧請見聞疑罪，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī, when the rains retreat has ended, doesn’t invite the bhikkhu sangha with regards to offenses seen, heard, or suspected, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>若僧不和集，若八難時，不犯。</lzh>
If the sangha doesn’t gather in harmony, or if there are the eight difficulties, the offense isn’t committed.
