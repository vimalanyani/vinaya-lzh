<h2>Origin Stories</h2>

<lzh>爾時偷羅難陀比丘尼常出入波斯匿王宮內，王言：「阿姨！若有所須就我取之。」便語言：「我須重衣。」王言：「就後宮取。」即復言：「我欲得王所著欽婆羅。」王即與之。諸臣譏訶言：「此比丘尼於無為法中出家，著壞色割截衣，而今云何乃索王所著者？王雖無惜，受者自應知量！此輩常說少欲知足，而今無厭！無沙門行，破沙門法！」</lzh>
At that time, Thullanandā bhikkhunī often went in and out of the palace of king Pasenadi. The king said: “Venerable, if you need anything, just take it from me.” Then she said: “I need a heavy robe.” The king said: “Just take one from the inner palace.” She said again: “I want to obtain the woolen robe that the king wears.” The king then gave it to her. The high officials criticized her: “This bhikkhunī hasn’t gone forth in the dhamma. She wears a patchwork robe of stained colors, so why does she now asks for what the king wears? Even though the king isn’t stingy, the recipient should know the right measure herself. These people always say that they’ve few wishes and know moderation, but now she has no limit. This isn’t the practice of renunciates. She has broken the rules of renunciates.” 

<lzh>時黑離車比丘尼為毘舍離諸離車恭敬供養。諸人若有官事，能為救解，莫不歡喜言：「我蒙阿姨恩得免罪厄，今有所須，當以相奉！」便言：「我須重衣！」復言：「須幾價重衣？」答言：「須千錢價衣！」諸人便譏訶言：「我曹官事，雖復費用五倍、六倍，不及此價！此輩常說少欲知足，而今無厭！」諸長老比丘尼聞，種種訶責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
Then Kālī, the Licchavi bhikkhunī, was respected and supported by the Licchavis of Vesālī. If people had legal issues, she could resolve them, and there was nobody who wasn’t happy and said: “We received the venerable’s compassion, and managed to avoid transgressions and disaster. Now if there’s anything you need, we’ll respectfully offer it to you.” Then she said: “I need a heavy robe.” They said again: “You need a heavy robe worth how much?” She answered: “I need a robe worth 1,000 coins.” Then the people were upset and said: “In our legal issues, even if we spents five or six times more, it still wouldn’t reach this price! These people always say that they’ve few wishes and know moderation, but now she has no limit.”
When the senior bhikkhunīs heard it, they criticized her in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，乞重衣，應取賤價直四大錢者；若受貴價衣，尼薩耆波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī asks for a heavy robe, she should take a cheap one worth four large coins. If she accepts a more expensive robe, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>重衣者：寒時衣。</lzh>
“A heavy robe” means a winter robe.

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼，突吉羅。</lzh>
For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.
