<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼未滿十二歲畜眷屬，不能教誡，不能攝取，弟子愚闇無知不能學戒。諸長老比丘尼見，種種訶責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, bhikkhunīs who didn’t have 12 vassa yet, took on disciples. They weren’t able to instruct or assist them, and the students were ignorant and without knowledge, and unable to train in the precepts. When the senior bhikkhunīs saw it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，不滿十二歲畜眷屬，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī, who doesn’t have 12 vassa yet, takes on a disciple, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>不滿十二歲者：受戒未滿十二歲。</lzh>
“Not having 12 vassa yet” means it hasn’t been 12 years since her full ordination.

<lzh>畜眷屬者：為人作和尚。</lzh>
“Taking on a disciple” means acting as preceptor for someone.

<lzh>若發心欲畜眾，至白四羯磨未竟，突吉羅。白四羯磨竟，和尚，波逸提；餘尼師僧，突吉羅。</lzh>
If the wish to take on students arises in her mind, up to when the formal act with a motion as fourth isn’t finished yet, it’s a dukkaṭa. If the formal act with a motion as fourth is finished, it’s a pācittiya for the preceptor. For the other bhikkhunī teachers and the sangha, it’s a dukkaṭa.
