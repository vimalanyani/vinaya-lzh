<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時有居士請比丘尼僧食。諸比丘尼食前著衣持鉢往到其家，從作食人索飲、或索釜燋、或索飯。作食人，作是念：「今辦此食，正為此輩，前與、後與，亦復何在？」便盡與之，飯飲都盡。主人至時打犍槌集僧，勅使下食，作食人具以事答，居士便譏呵言：「此諸比丘尼如小兒，不能小忍！貪食如此，何道之有？」諸長老比丘尼聞，種種呵責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, there was a householder who invited the bhikkhunī sangha for a meal. Before the meal, the bhikkhunīs put on their robes, took their bowls, and went to their house. Some requested drinks from the cook, others requested things to be cooked in a pot, and still others requested rice. The cook thought: “I now prepare these foods, truly (intended) for these people. Whether I give now or later, what does it matter?” Then they gave everything, and the food and drinks were all used up. When the time had come, the owner struck the bell to gather the sangha, informed them to receive food, and the cook explained this matter in full. The householder then criticized them: “These bhikkhunīs are like little babies, they can’t endure even a little. They crave for food like this, what kind of path do they have?” When the senior bhikkhunīs heard it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，受請，主人未唱隨意食；食者，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī accepts an invitation, and just eats food as she pleases, when the owner hasn’t asked her to yet, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>若未唱隨意食食，口口波逸提。</lzh>
If she eats food as she pleases when she hasn’t been asked to yet, each mouthful is a pācittiya.

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼，突吉羅。</lzh>
For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.
