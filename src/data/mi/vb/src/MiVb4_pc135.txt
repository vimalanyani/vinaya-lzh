<h2>Origin Stories</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼擲屎溺於籬牆外，污泥人及非人。</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs threw excrement and urine over fences and walls, and soiled and dirtied humans and non-humans.

<lzh>時有婆羅門大臣被冕，齋潔清淨，晨朝洗浴，著香熏衣，欲至天祠求復其官，裹頭行路，恐見剃髮割截衣人；至比丘尼牆外，遇值擲屎灌其頭上，舉體流漫，便大恚言：「我畏見此不吉人，而今乃為擲屎所灌，必是我命不吉祥事；然我要當至波斯匿王所，言殺禿婢！」於是便還，逢一相師婆羅門。婆羅門問言：「何故如此？」具以事答。相師言：「乃是大吉！汝今當得金錢一千，復本官位！」猶瞋不已，持此屎污之形，逕詣王所。王問：「何故如此？」即具以事答。王拍手大笑，即勅賜金錢一千，復先官位。王諸傍臣便譏訶言：「擲屎污人，豈是求道濟物之意！」諸長老比丘尼聞，種種訶責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
Then there was a brahmin high official wearing a ceremonial hat, having ritually cleaned himself and being pure, having bathed in the morning, wearing perfumed robes, who wanted to go to a brahminical temple to call on the temple manager. He wrapped his head while walking in the streets, fearful of seeing a shaven-headed patchwork-robed person. When he reached the outside of the bhikkhunīs’ wall, it so happened that someone threw out excrement which flowed over his head, and streamed down his entire body. Then he said greatly angered: “I feared to see these inauspicious people, but now the excrement that they’ve thown out flows over me. This must be the most inauspicious thing in my life. So I must go to king Pasenadi and tell him to kill these bald slavewomen.” At this, he returned, and met a brahmin fortune-teller. That brahmin asked him: “Why are you like this?”, and he explained this matter in full. The fortune-teller said: “It really is highly auspicious! Now you’ll obtain 1,000 gold coins, and also your original official rank.”<note>For the full story of how he lost his original rank, see Mūlasarvāstivāda bhikkhunī pācittiya 80.</note> His anger still hadn’t stopped, and while his body was still soiled with excrement, he went straight to the king. The king asked: “Why are you like this?”, and he explained this matter in full. The king clapped his hands and laughed much. Then he granted him 1,000 gold coins, and also his earlier official rank. The king’s ministers criticized it: “Throwing excrement and soiling people, how could they possibly have the intention of seeking the path and saving others?” When the senior bhikkhunīs heard it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，擲屎溺於籬牆外，若使人擲，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī throws excrement and urine over a fence or wall, or has others throw them, it’s a pācittiya.’”
