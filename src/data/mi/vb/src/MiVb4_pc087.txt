<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼，以比丘尼衣與白衣及外道女。彼便著行，餘白衣見，向作禮，彼言：「我是白衣！」「我是外道！」諸白衣便譏訶言：「云何比丘尼，以比丘尼衣與白衣及外道女？」諸長老比丘尼聞，種種訶責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs gave bhikkhunī robes to lay women and non-Buddhist female renunciates. They then put them on and walked around. When the other lay people saw them and paid respect to them, they said: “I’m a lay person. I’m a non-Buddhist renunciate.” Then the lay people criticized them: “Why does a bhikkhunī give bhikkhunī robes to lay women and non-Buddhist female renunciates?” When the senior bhikkhunīs heard it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，以比丘尼衣與白衣及外道女，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī gives a bhikkhunī robe to a lay woman or a non-Buddhist female renunciate, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼衣者：有葉、有緣、有帖。</lzh>
“A bhikkhunī robe” means it has cloth panels, borders, and strips.

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼，突吉羅。</lzh>
For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>彼有比丘尼衣，從貿易；若負債，用償，皆不犯。</lzh>
If they have a bhikkhunī robe from an exchange, or if they borrow, use, and return it, in both cases the offense isn’t committed.
