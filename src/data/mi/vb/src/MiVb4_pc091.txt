<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼於無比丘眾處安居，便有諸疑：可應度、不可應度，可與受戒、不可與受戒，作衣如法、不如法。於戒中有如是等種種疑，不知問誰？又為惡人、外道之所輕𣣋。諸長老比丘尼見，種種訶責，以事白佛。佛以是事集二部僧，問諸比丘尼：「汝等實爾不？」答言：「實爾。世尊！」佛種種訶責言：「我先不說八敬法，比丘尼應依比丘眾安居耶？」訶已，告諸比丘：「今為諸比丘尼結戒，從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs entered the rains retreat in a place without a group of bhikkhus. Then they had these doubts: “May we give the going forth, may we not give the going forth, may we give (the full) ordination, may we not give (the full) ordination, are the robes according to the rules or not?” And they had all kinds of similar doubts about the precepts and didn’t know whom to ask. Moreover, they were treated with disrespect by bad people and non-Buddhist renunciates. When the senior bhikkhunīs saw it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, and told the Buddha of this matter. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter and asked the bhikkhunīs: “Did you really do this?” They answered: “We really did it, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized them in all kinds of ways: “Haven’t I already taught the eight rules of respect: A bhikkhunī should enter the rains retreat supported by a group of bhikkhus?” Having criticized them, he told the bhikkhus: “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，不依比丘眾安居，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī enters the rains retreat without support from a group of bhikkhus, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>雖依比丘眾，而無教誡者，突吉羅。</lzh>
Even if they’ve support from a group of bhikkhus, but if there’s no instruction, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼，突吉羅。</lzh>
For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>若安居中比丘眾移去、死亡、罷道；若為強力所制；若病，皆不犯。</lzh>
If during the rains retreat, the group of bhikkhus moves away, dies, or disrobes; if she’s held by force, or if she’s sick, in all cases the offense isn’t committed.
