<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時有一長者以宅布施比丘僧，比丘僧與比丘尼眾貿安陀林。末利夫人後以王園施比丘尼僧，比丘尼僧壞前所貿處屋，於王園更起，先處便成空地。</lzh>
At that time, there was a householder who offered a residence to the bhikkhu sangha. The bhikkhu sangha exchanged it with the bhikkhunī sangha for the Andhavana (Dark Wood). Later, Lady Mallikā gave the king’s park to the bhikkhunī sangha, and they dismantled the building on the previously exchanged land and erected it again in the king’s park. The previous place then became an empty piece of land.
<lzh>時施宅長者子作是念：「我父昔以施僧，僧與比丘尼貿。今諸比丘尼不復住中，我可還取，於中耕種。」即便取之。諸比丘尼語言：「汝莫取僧地！」答言：「我父雖以施僧，僧不復用，應還屬我！」諸比丘尼言：「我等不捨此地，勿使詣官言汝，更大輸物！」彼不肯還，即詣官言之，便大輸物。諸居士見，譏訶言：「云何此比丘尼詣官言人，使大失物？此輩受彼供養，猶尚言之，況於餘人！無沙門行，破沙門法！」諸長老比丘尼聞，種種訶責，以事白佛。佛以是事集二部僧，問諸比丘尼：「汝等實爾不？」答言：「實爾。世尊！」佛種種訶責已，告諸比丘：「今為諸比丘尼結戒，從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
Then the son of the householder who had offered the residence thought: “My father has formerly offered it to the sangha, and the sangha exchanged it with the bhikkhunīs. Now the bhikkhunīs don’t live there anymore. I can take it back and plow and sow there.” Then he took it. The bhikkhunīs said: “Don’t take the sangha’s land!” He answered: “Even though my father has offered it to the sangha, the sangha isn’t using it anymore. You should return ownership to me.” The bhikkhunīs said: “We don’t give up this land. Don’t make us go to the official and speak about you, he’ll impose a heavy fine on your property.” He refused to give it back, and then they went to the official and spoke about him. Then (the official) imposed a heavy fine on his property. When the householders saw it, they criticized them: “Why did these bhikkhunīs go to the official and speak about him, and cause him great loss of property. These people received his support, and still speak about him, so what about other people? This isn’t the practice of renunciates. They’ve broken the rules of renunciates.” When the senior bhikkhunīs heard it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, and told the Buddha of this matter. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter and asked the bhikkhunīs: “Did you really do this?” They answered: “We really did this, World-honored One.” When the Buddha had criticized them in all kinds of ways, he told the bhikkhus: “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，詣官言人，是比丘尼初犯僧伽婆尸沙，可悔過。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī goes to an official to speak about a person, that bhikkhunī commits an immediate saṅghādisesa, from which one can repent.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>若比丘尼，為人輕𣣋，應語其父母；若無父母，應語其親族；若無親族，應語比丘、比丘尼、優婆塞、優婆夷。若比丘、比丘尼有勢力，不援護者，突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī is treated with disrespect by people, she should tell their parents. If they don’t have parents, she should speak with their relations. If they don’t have relations, she should speak with the bhikkhus, bhikkhunīs, lay men, and lay women. If a bhikkhu or bhikkhunī is powerful, but doesn’t help and protect her, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>語時應云：「彼輕𣣋我。」</lzh>
When she speaks, she should say: “They’re treating me with disrespect.”

<lzh>「為我訶諫！」不應言之。</lzh>
She shouldn’t say: “Criticize and admonish them for me!”

<lzh>若詣官言人，一往返，一僧伽婆尸沙。</lzh>
If she goes to an official to speak about a person, each trip is one saṅghādisesa.

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼，突吉羅。</lzh>
For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.
