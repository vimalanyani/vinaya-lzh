<h2>First Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時有一下坐比丘尼得未成衣，少知識，自不知作，持至偷羅難陀比丘尼所求作。答言：「我多事不得為汝作！」復持至餘比丘尼所，餘比丘尼為作作成。偷羅難陀問言：「誰為汝作？取來看，為如法不？」即以示之。便言：「此衣不如法，可速撤壞！我更為汝作。」彼即撤壞，持往，便不為作；彼比丘尼不能得成，著麁弊衣行，所壞衣叚曬於屋上。爾時失火，為火所燒，風吹墮白衣屋上，延燒諸家。白衣見火從比丘尼住處來，便瞋訶言：「我等供養此比丘尼，反成怨家！」諸長老比丘尼聞，種種呵責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, there was a junior bhikkhunī who obtained a cloth that wasn’t made into a robe yet. She had little knowledge, and didn’t know how to do it. She took it, went to Thullanandā bhikkhunī and asked her to do it. She answered: “I’m very busy and not able to do it for you.” (The junior bhikkhunī) took the cloth again, went to the other bhikkhunīs, and they made and completed it. Thullanandā asked her: “Who made it for you? Bring it and let me see if it’s according to the rules.” Then she showed it, and (Thullanandā) said: “This robe isn’t according to the rules. Please unsew it and take it apart quickly. I’ll redo it for you.” She then unsewed it and took it apart, (and Thullanandā) took it away, and didn’t redo it. The bhikkhunī wasn’t able to have it completed, and walked around wearing coarse, worn out robes. The robe that had been taken apart was being ventilated in the sun on the roof of the building. At that time, a fire broke out, and (the robe) was burnt, blown away by the wind, fell on the roof of a lay house, and set the house on fire. When the lay people saw that the fire had come from the bhikkhunī residence, they angrily criticized them: “We support these bhikkhunīs, and in return they become our enemy.” When the senior bhikkhunīs heard it, they criticized her in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>First Preliminary Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，自撤比丘尼衣，若使人撤，不還縫成，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī has unsewn another bhikkhunī’s robe herself, or had others unsew it, and doesn’t sew it back together, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Second Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>復有比丘尼撤比丘尼衣，一日不得成，四、五日乃竟，以事白佛。佛以是事集二部僧，告諸比丘：「今聽諸比丘尼撤衣四、五日成。從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
There was also a bhikkhunī who unsewed another bhikkhunī’s robe, and wasn’t able to complete it within one day. After four to five days, it was finished. They told the Buddha of this matter. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter and told the bhikkhus: “I now allow the bhikkhunīs to unsew a robe and to complete it within four to five days. From now on, this precept should be recited thus:


<h2>Second Preliminary Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，撤比丘尼衣，若使人撤，過四、五日不成，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī has unsewn another bhikkhunī’s robe, or had others unsew it, and doesn’t complete it within four to five days, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Third Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>復有比丘尼撤比丘尼衣，得病不能成，以是白佛。佛以是事集二部僧，告諸比丘：「今聽諸比丘尼撤他衣已，病不得成。從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
There was also a bhikkhunī who unsewed another bhikkhunī’s robe, became sick, and wasn’t able to complete it. They told the Buddha of this. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter and told the bhikkhus: “I now allow the bhikkhunīs, having unsewn someone else’s robe, and being sick, to not complete it. From now on, this precept should be recited thus:


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，撤比丘尼衣已，無病過四、五日不成，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī has unsewn another bhikkhunī’s robe, and when she’s not sick, doesn’t complete it within four or five days, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼，突吉羅。</lzh>
For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.
