<lzh>Preliminaries</lzh>

<h2>Preliminaries</h2>

<lzh>大姊僧聽。春時一月過少一夜。餘有一夜三月在。老死至近佛法欲滅。諸大姊。為得道故。一心勤精進。所以者何。諸佛一心勤精進故。得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提。何況餘善道法。</lzh>
“Venerable sisters, may the sangha listen. The first month of the spring season has already passed, except for one night. One night and three months remain. Old age and death are drawing near, and the Buddha’s dhamma will extinguish. Venerable sisters, to realize the path, strive single-mindedly with diligence. Why? Because the Buddhas have striven single-mindedly with diligence, they’ve realized unsurpassed perfect enlightenment, let alone the other wholesome path-factors.


<h2>Introductory Verses</h2>

<lzh-verse>合十指爪掌　　供養釋師子
我今欲說戒　　僧當一心聽
乃至小罪中　　心應大怖畏
有罪一心悔　　後更莫復犯
心馬馳惡道　　放逸難禁制
佛說切戒行　　亦如利轡勒
佛口說教誡　　善者能信受
是人馬調順　　能破煩惱軍
若不受教勅　　亦不愛樂戒
是人馬不調　　沒在煩惱軍
若人守護戒　　如犛牛愛尾
繫心不放逸　　亦如猴著鎖
日夜常精進　　求實智慧故
是人佛法中　　能得清淨命</lzh-verse>

<verse>Joining the palms and the ten fingers together we venerate the Sakyan lion.
I now want to recite the precepts, may the sangha listen single-mindedly.
Even towards the small offenses, our hearts should feel great fear.
Having committed an offense, one should single-mindedly repent, and not transgress again later.
The horse-like mind runs down the evil paths, negligence is difficult to restrain.
The Buddha said that we must practise the precepts, as beneficial bridle and reins.
The Buddha gave these instructions, so that the good can attain faith.
That person is like an obedient horse, that can destroy the army of defilements.
If one doesn’t receive these teachings, and doesn’t feel love and happiness towards the precepts,
That person is like an untamed horse, that will founder against the army of defilements.
If someone protects the precepts like a yak its tail,
With their mind restrained without any negligence, like a locked-up monkey,
Making an intense effort day and night to seek true wisdom,
That person can attain a pure life in the Buddha’s dhamma.</verse>


<lzh>未受具戒者出(有者依言遣出無者答言此處無未受具戒人)諸大姊。不來諸比丘尼。說欲及清淨。(有者依言說無者答言此處無說欲人)僧今和合。先作何事。(答言說戒羯磨)</lzh>
Those who haven’t received the full precepts yet should leave.” (If there are such persons, they should be asked to leave. If there are none, one answers: “In this place, there aren’t any persons who haven’t received the full precepts yet.”) 
“Venerable sisters, have the bhikkhunīs who haven’t come given their consent and their purity?” (If there are such bhikkhunīs, one should reply accordingly; if there are none, one should answer: “In this place, nobody has given consent.”)
“The sangha is now in harmony. What should we do first?” (One answers: “Recite the formal act of the precepts.”)

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<lzh>大姊僧聽。今十五日布薩說戒。僧一心作布薩說戒。若僧時到僧忍聽。白如是。</lzh>
“Venerable sisters, may the sangha listen. Today is the uposatha precept recitation of the fifteenth day. The sangha single-mindedly carries out the uposatha precept recitation. If the right time has come for the sangha, may the sangha approve. This is the motion.

<lzh>諸大姊。今布薩說波羅提木叉。一切共聽。善思念之。若有罪應發露。無罪者默然。默然故當知我及諸大姊清淨。如聖默然。我及諸大姊亦如是。若比丘尼如是眾中乃至三唱。憶有罪不發露。得故妄語罪。故妄語罪佛說遮道法。發露者得安樂。不發露罪益深。諸大姊。已說戒經序。今問。諸大姊。是中清淨不。(第二第三亦如是說)諸大姊是中清淨。默然故。是事如是持。</lzh>
Venerable sisters, today is the pātimokkha recitation of the uposatha. All should listen together and consider it well. If you have an offense, you should disclose it. If you have no offense, you should remain silent. By your silence we will know that I and the venerable sisters are pure. As the silence of the noble ones, I and the venerable sisters will also be like this. If a bhikkhunī is questioned like this in the midst of the sangha up to three times, and she remembers that she has an offense but doesn’t disclose it, she incurs an offense of intentional lying. The Buddha has said that the offense of intentional lying is something that obstructs the path. One disclosing it obtains peace and happiness. Not disclosing it increases the offense. Venerable sisters, I’ve recited the introduction to the precepts sutta. Now I ask the venerable sisters: ‘Are you pure herein?’ (Repeat a second and third time.) The venerable sisters are pure herein, therefore you’re silent. This matter is remembered thus.

<lzh>8 Pārājika Rules</lzh>

<h2>Eight Pārājika Rules</h2>

<lzh>諸大姊。是八波羅夷法。半月半月戒經中說</lzh>
Venerable sisters, these eight pārājika rules are recited every half-month in the precepts sutta.

If a bhikkhunī who trains together with the other bhikkhunīs in the precepts and rules, whose precepts are weak, but who hasn’t given them up, intentionally engages in sexual intercourse even together with an animal, that bhikkhunī incurs a pārājika, and doesn’t live in community.

If a bhikkhunī in a village or an empty place takes what isn’t given with the intention to steal it, and if the king or a high official either arrest, or bind, or kill, or banish her, and say: ‘You criminal, you child, you fool!,’ that bhikkhunī incurs a pārājika, and doesn’t live in community.

<lzh>Pārājika 3</lzh>
<h3>Pārājika 3</h3>

<lzh>若比丘尼。若人若似人。若自殺若與刀藥殺。若教人殺若教自殺。譽死讚死。咄人用惡活為死勝生。作是心隨心殺。如是種種因緣。彼因是死。是比丘尼得波羅夷不共住。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī kills a human being or a human-like being, either herself, or by giving them a knife or poison, or by instructing people to kill, or by instructing people to commit suicide, praising and commending death: ‘Hey you, what use is this bad life? Death is better than living on!’, thus creating such intentions and following them to kill, and if someone dies because of these various causes, that bhikkhunī incurs a pārājika, and doesn’t live in community.

<lzh>Pārājika 4</lzh>
<h3>Pārājika 4</h3>

<lzh>若比丘尼。不知不。見過人法聖利滿足。自稱我如是知如是見。是比丘尼後時若問若不問。為出罪求清淨故作是言。我不知言知不見言見。虛誑妄語。除增上慢。是比丘尼得波羅夷不共住。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī doesn’t know and doesn’t see a superhuman state, the completion of a noble attainment, and praises herself: ‘I know in this way, I see in this way,’ and if that bhikkhunī at a later time, whether questioned or not questioned, in order to clear the offense and to seek purification, says this: ‘I not knowing said I know, not seeing said I see. It was empty, untrue, false speech,’ except in a case of superiority conceit, that bhikkhunī incurs a pārājika, and doesn’t live in community.

<lzh>Pārājika 5</lzh>
<h3>Pārājika 5</h3>

<lzh>若比丘尼。欲盛變心。受男子種種摩觸。髮際已下膝已上肘已後。是比丘尼得波羅夷不共住。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī in a mindstate altered by abundant desire, lets a man rub and touch her in all kinds of ways below the hairline, above the knees, and above the elbows, that bhikkhunī incurs a pārājika, and doesn’t live in community.

<lzh>Pārājika 6</lzh>
<h3>Pārājika 6</h3>

<lzh>若比丘尼。欲盛變心。受男子捉手捉衣共期獨共行獨共住獨共語獨共一座坐身親近男子。八法具者。是比丘尼得波羅夷不共住。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī, in a mindstate altered by abundant desire, lets a man hold her hand, hold her robe, makes an appointment with him, walks with him alone, stands with him alone, talks with him alone, sits with him alone on one seat, or brings her body close to the man, completing these eight things, that bhikkhunī incurs a pārājika, and doesn’t live in community.

<lzh>Pārājika 7</lzh>
<h3>Pārājika 7</h3>

<lzh>若比丘尼。知僧如法與比丘作不見罪羯磨。諸比丘不共住不共事不共語。而隨順之。諸比丘尼語是比丘尼。姊妹。此比丘僧已作不見罪羯磨。諸比丘不共住不共事不共語。汝莫隨順。如是諫堅持不捨。應第二第三諫。第二第三諫捨是事善。不捨者。是比丘尼得波羅夷不共住。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī knows that the sangha has carried out a formal act for not seeing offenses according to dhamma against a bhikkhu, and that the bhikkhus don’t live with him, don’t conduct their matters with him, and don’t talk with him, but she follows him, the other bhikkhunīs should tell that bhikkhunī: ‘Sister, the (bhikkhu) sangha has carried out a formal act for not seeing offenses against this bhikkhu. The bhikkhus don’t live with him, don’t conduct their matters with him, and don’t talk with him. Don’t follow him.’ If she, when admonished like this, holds firmly on to it and doesn’t give it up, they should admonish her a second and a third time. If she gives up this matter at the second or third admonishment, it’s fine. If not, that bhikkhunī incurs a pārājika, and doesn’t live in community.

<lzh>Pārājika 8</lzh>
<h3>Pārājika 8</h3>

<lzh>若比丘尼。見比丘尼犯波羅夷覆藏。彼比丘尼後時。若在若死。若遠行若被擯。若罷道若變形。作是語。我先親見其犯波羅夷。是比丘尼得波羅夷不共住。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī sees that another bhikkhunī commits a pārājika, and conceals it, and if, when that other bhikkhunī later stays on, dies, wanders far away, is expelled, disrobes, or joins non-Buddhist renunciates, the first bhikkhunī says: ‘I earlier saw for myself that she committed a pārājika,’ that bhikkhunī incurs a pārājika, and doesn’t live in community.

<lzh>諸大姊。已說八波羅夷法。若比丘尼犯一一戒。不得共住。如前後亦如是。是比丘尼得波羅夷罪不應共住。今問。諸大姊。是中清淨不(第二第三亦如是說)</lzh>
Venerable sisters, I’ve recited the eight pārājika rules. If a bhikkhunī has broken any of these rules, she may not live in community. As before, so also afterwards.<note>i.e. she reverts to a lay person, as before.</note> That bhikkhunī incurs a pārājika offense, and should not live in community. Now I ask the venerable sisters: ‘Are you pure herein?’ (Repeat a second and third time.)

<lzh>諸大姊是中清淨。默然故。是事如是持。</lzh>
The venerable sisters are pure herein, therefore you’re silent. This matter is remembered thus.

If a bhikkhunī herself doesn’t act according to dhamma, and because of unwholesome anger slanders a bhikkhunī, who hasn’t commited a pārājika, with an unfounded pārājika, wanting to destroy her monastic life, and if that bhikkhunī at a later time, whether questioned or not questioned, says: ‘That matter was unfounded, I slandered her because I was harboring anger,’ that bhikkhunī commits an immediate saṅghādisesa, from which one can repent.

Our minds accept and delight in everything,’ the other bhikkhunīs should say to these bhikkhunīs: ‘Don’t say this: “What that bhikkhunī says is said with knowledge, not without knowledge; she speaks dhamma, not contrary to dhamma; she speaks vinaya, not contrary to vinaya. Our minds accept and delight in everything.” Why? That bhikkhunī speaks without knowledge, contrary to dhamma, and contrary to vinaya. Don’t delight in helping to split the sangha in harmony. You should delight in helping the sangha in harmony. Because a sangha is in harmony, they’re happy, don’t quarrel, they’re of one mind and one training, mixing like water and milk, spreading the master’s teaching together, and living comfortably.’ If they, when admonished like this, hold firmly on to it and don’t give it up, they should admonish them a second and a third time.

If a bhikkhunī is of bad character and difficult to talk to, while training in the precepts sutta together with the other bhikkhunīs, she often commits offenses, and when the bhikkhunīs admonish her about her offenses according to dhamma and vinaya, she answers: ‘Venerables, don’t talk to me about good and bad. I’ll also not talk to you about good or bad,’ the bhikkhunīs should say again: ‘Don’t make yourself unadressable by others. You should speak with the bhikkhunīs according to dhamma, and the bhikkhunīs will also speak with you according to dhamma. In this way, we teach each other, we rehabilitate each other from offenses, and perfect the Tathāgata’s assembly.’ If she, when admonished like this, holds firmly on to it and doesn’t give it up, they should admonish her a second and a third time. If she gives up this matter at the second or third admonishment, it’s fine. If not, that bhikkhunī commits a saṅghādisesa after three admonishments, from which one can repent.

If a bhikkhunī lives supported by a village, engages in unwholesome conduct and corrupts families, and all of her unwholesome conduct is seen and heard and known, and the corrupted families are also seen and heard and known, the bhikkhunīs should address that bhikkhunī: ‘You engage in unwholesome conduct and corrupt families. All of your unwholesome conduct is seen and heard and known, and the corrupted families are also seen and heard and known. Go away, you shouldn’t live among us!’ If that bhikkhunī says: ‘The venerables follow desire, anger, delusion, and fear. Why? There are also other bhikkhunīs with the same offense. Some of them are expelled, some aren’t expelled,’ the bhikkhunīs should say again: ‘Don’t say: “The venerables follow desire, anger, delusion, and fear. Why? There are also other bhikkhunīs with the same offense. Some of them are expelled, some aren’t expelled.” You engage in unwholesome conduct and corrupt families. All of your unwholesome conduct is seen and heard and known, and the corrupted families are also seen and heard and known. You should give up this speech about following desire, anger, delusion, and fear. Go away, you shouldn’t live among us!’ If she, when admonished like this, holds firmly on to it and doesn’t give it up, they should admonish her a second and a third time. If she gives up this matter at the second or third admonishment, it’s fine. If not, that bhikkhunī commits a saṅghādisesa after three admonishments, from which one can repent.

<lzh>若二比丘尼共作惡行有惡名聲。更相覆罪觸惱眾僧。諸比丘尼語言。汝二比丘尼共作惡行有惡名聲。更相覆罪觸惱眾僧。汝相遠離捨是作惡觸惱僧事。於佛法中增廣得安樂住。彼二比丘尼言。我等不作惡行無惡名聲。不相覆罪不觸惱僧。此中更有餘二比丘尼。共作惡行觸惱眾僧。諸比丘尼復語言。莫作是語。何以故。此中更無餘二比丘尼作惡惱僧。唯有汝等。可相遠離捨是作惡觸惱僧事。於佛法中增廣得安樂住。如是諫堅持不捨。應第二第三諫。第二第三諫捨是事善。不捨者。是比丘尼三諫。犯僧伽婆尸沙可悔過。</lzh>
If two bhikkhunīs engage in unwholesome conduct together, have a bad reputation, cover up each other’s offenses, and irritate the sangha, the bhikkhunīs should say: ‘You two bhikkhunīs engage in unwholesome conduct, have a bad reputation, cover up each other’s offenses, and irritate the sangha. Live apart from each other, and give up this matter of practising the unwholesome and irritating the sangha. You’ll grow in the Buddha’s dhamma and live comfortably.’ If these two bhikkhunīs say: ‘We don’t engage in unwholesome conduct, there’s no bad reputation, we don’t cover up each other’s offenses, and don’t irritate the sangha. There are two other bhikkhunīs here who engage in unwholesome conduct together, and irritate the sangha,’ the bhikkhunīs should say again: ‘Don’t say this. Why? There are no other two bhikkhunīs here who practise the unwholesome and irritate the sangha, only you. Please live apart from each other, and give up this matter of practising the unwholesome and irritating the sangha. You’ll grow in the Buddha’s dhamma and live comfortably.’ If they, when admonished like this, hold firmly on to it and don’t give it up, they should admonish them a second and a third time. If they give up this matter at the second or third admonishment, it’s fine. If not, those bhikkhunīs commit a saṅghādisesa after three admonishments, from which one can repent.

If two bhikkhunīs engage in unwholesome conduct together, have a bad reputation, cover up each other’s offenses, and irritate the sangha, the bhikkhunīs should say: ‘You two bhikkhunīs engage in unwholesome conduct, have a bad reputation, cover up each other’s offenses, and irritate the sangha. Live apart from each other, and give up this matter of practising the unwholesome and irritating the sangha. You’ll grow in the Buddha’s dhamma and live comfortably.’ If the two bhikkhunīs say: ‘We don’t engage in unwholesome conduct, there’s no bad reputation, we don’t cover up each other’s offenses, and don’t irritate the sangha. The sangha sees us as weak, and they speak like this because they look down on us,’ the bhikkhunīs should say again: ‘Don’t say this! Why? The sangha doesn’t see you as weak and looks down on you. Please live apart from each other, and give up this matter of practising the unwholesome and irritating the sangha. You’ll grow in the Buddha’s dhamma and live comfortably.’ If they, when admonished like this, hold firmly on to it and don’t give it up, they should admonish them a second and a third time. If they give up this matter at the second or third admonishment, it’s fine. If not, those bhikkhunīs commit a saṅghādisesa after three admonishments, from which one can repent.

If a bhikkhunī often quarrels with others, and when the sangha has settled matters, says: ‘The sangha follows desire, anger, delusion, and fear,’ the bhikkhunīs should say: ‘Don’t often quarrel with others, and don’t say: “The sangha follows desire, anger, delusion, and fear.” Why? The sangha doesn’t follow desire, anger, delusion, and fear. Give up this speech. You’ll grow in the Buddha’s dhamma and live comfortably.’ If she, when admonished like this, holds firmly on to it and doesn’t give it up, they should admonish her a second and a third time. If she gives up this matter at the second or third admonishment, it’s fine. If not, that bhikkhunī commits a saṅghādisesa after three admonishments, from which one can repent.

If a bhikkhunī often quarrels with others, and when the sangha has settled matters, says: ‘I renounce the Buddha, I renounce the dhamma, I renounce the sangha. I renounce the precepts and will become a non-Buddhist renunciate. Other renunciates and brahmins also train in precepts and have shame. I’ll be able to practise the monastic life with them,’ the bhikkhunīs should say: ‘Don’t often quarrel with others, and don’t say: “I renounce the Buddha, the dhamma, and the sangha.” Why? Other renunciates and brahmins don’t train in precepts and don’t have shame. How would you be able to practise the monastic life with them? Give up this wrong view. You’ll grow in the Buddha’s dhamma and live comfortably.’ If she, when admonished like this, holds firmly on to it and doesn’t give it up, they should admonish her a second and a third time. If she gives up this matter at the second or third admonishment, it’s fine. If not, that bhikkhunī commits a saṅghādisesa after three admonishments, from which one can repent.

Venerable sisters, I’ve recited the 17 saṅghādisesa rules; nine immediate offenses, and eight offenses after the third admonishment. If a bhikkhunī has committed any of these offenses, she should undergo probation<note>Mānatta</note> for half a month before both assemblies. She then reaches the rehabilitation<note>Abbhāna</note> in which, when carried out according to dhamma, both assemblies of 20 persons each should rehabilitate her. If there is one person less, she doesn’t count as rehabilitated, and the bhikkhunīs should also be criticized. This is how the procedure should be done. Now I ask the venerable sisters: ‘Are you pure herein?’ (Repeat a second and third time.) ‘The venerable sisters are pure herein, therefore you’re silent. This matter is remembered thus.’

If a king, a high official, a brahmin, or a householder sends a messenger with a robe fund for a bhikkhunī, and if that messenger goes to the bhikkhunī and says: ‘Venerable, that king or a high official sends this robe fund. The venerable should accept it,’ the bhikkhunī might say: ‘I shouldn’t accept a robe fund. If I obtain a pure robe, I’ll accept it with my hands and keep it.’ If the messenger says: ‘Venerable, do you have a manager?’, and the bhikkhunī then indicates a place, the messenger might go to the manager and say: ‘King or high official So-and-so sends this robe fund for bhikkhunī So-and-so. Accept and arrange it, take it and then give it to her.’ If the messenger, after having given it, returns to the bhikkhunī and tells her: ‘Venerable, I’ve given it to the manager you pointed out. When the venerable needs a robe, you can go there and take one,’ and that bhikkhunī goes to the manager two or three times and says: ‘I need a robe, I need a robe,’ and if she obtains it, it’s fine. If she doesn’t obtain it, she may go and stand silently in front of the manager for four, five, or six times. If she obtains it, it’s fine. If she tries to obtain the robe more times, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. If she doesn’t obtain the robe, she should either go herself to the place from where the messenger came, or send a message to say: ‘You sent a robe fund for bhikkhunī So-and-so. That bhikkhunī didn’t obtain it in the end. You should request a refund, don’t let it be lost.’ This matter should (be handled) thus.

<lzh>Conclusion</lzh>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<lzh>諸大姊。已說戒經序已。說八波羅夷法已。說十七僧伽婆尸沙法已。說三十尼薩耆波逸提法已。說二百一十波逸提法已。說八波羅提提舍尼法已。說眾學戒法。是法入佛戒經中。半月半月波羅提木叉中說。及餘隨道法。是中諸大姊。一心和合歡喜不諍。如水乳合安樂行。應當學。</lzh>
Venerable sisters, I’ve recited the introduction to the precepts sutta, the eight pārājika rules, the 17 saṅghādisesa rules, the 30 nissaggiya pācittiya rules, the 210 pācittiya rules, the eight pātidesanīya rules, and the many training rules. These rules are included in the Buddha’s precepts sutta, and are recited every half-month in the pātimokkha. And also the remaining rules that accord with the path, the venerable sisters should practise them all single-mindedly, harmoniously, happy, without quarreling, mixing like water and milk, peacefully and happy. This should be trained.

<verse>Just as when bees collect from flowers, they don’t damage their color or scent,

於瞋人中心常淨　　見人為惡自不作</lzh-verse>
<lzh-verse>七佛為世尊　　能救護世間

<verse>Protecting the body is good, protecting the speech is also good,
Protecting the mind is good, protecting everything is good.
A bhikkhu who protects everything, will be free from many sufferings.
A bhikkhu who guards the speech, mind, and body, doesn’t commit many evils.
When these three courses of action are pure, one will attain the path attained by the noble ones. 
Not retaliating when people beat and scold, with a mind without hate towards hostile people,
With a mind ever pure among hateful people, on seeing others doing evil not doing it oneself.</verse>

<verse>The seven Buddhas honored by the world, capable of saving and protecting the world, 
Spoke this precepts sutta, which I have now finished explaining in detail.
The Buddhas and their disciples venerated this precepts sutta.
Having venerated this precepts sutta, they venerated each other,
And having fully developed conscience and prudence, they could attain the path of nibbāna.</verse>


<lzh>諸大姊。已說波羅提木叉竟。僧一心得布薩。</lzh>
