<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼，雖滿十二歲已嫁女，而女聾啞種種諸病，與受具足戒，愚癡無知不能學戒。諸長老比丘尼見，種種訶責，乃至「今聽諸比丘尼白四羯磨，與滿十二歲已嫁女受具足戒。」
彼欲受具足戒人，應到比丘尼僧中，白言：「阿姨僧聽！我某甲已嫁，滿十二歲，求某甲和尚受具足戒，今從僧乞受具足戒。善哉！僧與我受具足戒，憐愍故！」如是三乞已，諸比丘尼應籌量可與受、不可與受。應一比丘尼羯磨，依如上說。告諸比丘：「今為諸比丘尼結戒，從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>

It’d be good if the sangha gave me the full ordination out of compassion.’ Having asked like this three times, the bhikkhunīs should evaluate if she’s eligible or not.

<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，滿十二歲已嫁女，僧不作羯磨，與受具足戒，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī gives a married woman who is 12 years old the full ordination, when the sangha hasn’t carried out a formal act, it’s a pācittiya.’”
