<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時優蹉比丘尼數數犯罪：上床、下床皆不如法，數數食，別眾食，非時入他家，比丘尼僧與作不見罪擯。時偷羅難陀比丘尼知優蹉心未調伏，不敬順僧，便不隨眾，自與眷屬，於界外為其解擯。彼比丘尼既得解擯，倍更憍慢，不敬眾僧。諸長老比丘尼見，種種訶責，以事白佛。佛以是事集二部僧，問偷羅難陀：「汝實爾不？」答言：「實爾。世尊！」佛種種訶責已，告諸比丘：「今為諸比丘尼結戒，從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, Youcuo bhikkhunī often committed offenses. From getting up to going to bed, everything wasn’t according to dhamma: she ate often, she ate in a separate group, and she entered people’s houses at the wrong time. The bhikkhunī sangha expelled her for not seeing offenses. Then Thullanandā bhikkhunī knew that Youcuo’s mind hadn’t yet been corrected, that she didn’t respect and obey the sangha, and that she didn’t follow the group. She released her from the expulsion herself with her followers outside the territory. When the bhikkhunī had then obtained release from the expulsion, she was twice as conceited and didn’t respect the sangha. When the senior bhikkhunīs saw it, they criticized her in all kinds of ways, and told the Buddha of this matter. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter and asked Thullanandā: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did it, World-honored One.” When the Buddha had criticized her in all kinds of ways, he told the bhikkhus: “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，知僧如法擯比丘尼，比丘尼心未調伏，不隨順僧，自與眷屬，於界外解其擯者，是比丘尼初犯僧伽婆尸沙，可悔過。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī knows that the sangha has expelled a bhikkhunī according to dhamma, and that that bhikkhunī’s mind hasn’t yet been corrected, and that she doesn’t follow the sangha, but she herself and her followers release her from the expulsion outside the territory, that bhikkhunī commits an immediate saṅghādisesa, from which one can repent.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>欲解擯及方便，乃至三羯磨未竟，皆突吉羅。三羯磨竟，羯磨師，僧伽婆尸沙；餘僧，皆偷羅遮。</lzh>
If she wants to release her from the expulsion and plans it, up to when the three announcements aren’t yet finished, each is a dukkaṭa. When the three announcements are finished, it’s a saṅghādisesa for the master of ceremony. For the rest of the sangha, it’s a thullaccaya each.
