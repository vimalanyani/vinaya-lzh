<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼裸形洗浴，諸白衣見，圍遶調笑。諸長老比丘尼聞，種種訶責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs bathed naked. Lay people saw it, surrounded them, and made fun of them. When the senior bhikkhunīs heard it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，裸形洗浴，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī bathes naked, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼，突吉羅。</lzh>
For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>若遮人不使來，若屏處浴，若樹、若衣物障，皆不犯。</lzh>
If it’s blocked off and people can’t come there, if she bathes in a secluded place, or if she’s concealed by a tree or a robe, in all cases the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>(八十)</lzh>
(80.)<note>This is actually the 81st precept. The numbering is out of alignment, because precept no. 36 is missing in the vibhaṅga, but included in the pātimokkha.</note>
