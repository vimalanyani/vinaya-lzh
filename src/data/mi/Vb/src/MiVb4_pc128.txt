<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼於闇處，與男子共立、共語，生染著心，不樂修梵行，致有反俗、作外道者。諸長老比丘尼聞，種種訶責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs stood and talked with men in a dark place and defiled attachment arose in their minds. They weren’t happy to practise celibacy, and returned to lay life, or became non-Buddhist renunciates. When the senior bhikkhunīs heard it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，與男子闇處共立、共語，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī stands and talks with a man in a dark place, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>若闇處語，語語波逸提。</lzh>
If they talk in a dark place, each word is a pācittiya.

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼，突吉羅。</lzh>
For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>若疑怖處，若燈卒滅，不犯。</lzh>
If it’s a dubious and frightening place, or if the lamp suddenly goes out, the offense isn’t committed.
