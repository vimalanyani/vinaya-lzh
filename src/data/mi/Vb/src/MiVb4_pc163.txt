<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼績縷，諸白衣譏呵言：「此等衣食仰他，不念行道以報信施，績縷何為？無沙門行！破沙門法！」諸長老比丘尼聞，種種呵責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>

Why do they spin thread? This isn’t the practice of renunciates. They’ve broken the rules of renunciates.” When the senior bhikkhunīs heard it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，績縷，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī spins thread, it’s a pācittiya.’”
