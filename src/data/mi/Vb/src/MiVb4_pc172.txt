<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼如法作驅出羯磨竟，被驅比丘尼不肯去。諸長老比丘尼種種呵責言：「被驅出羯磨與不被驅出羯磨，有何等異？」乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, when the bhikkhunīs had carried out a formal act of expulsion according to dhamma, the expelled bhikkhunī refused to leave. The senior bhikkhunīs criticized her in all kinds of ways: “Imposing a formal act of expulsion, or not imposing a formal act of expulsion, what’s the difference?” … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，被驅出羯磨，不去者，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī doesn’t leave when a formal act of expulsion was imposed on her, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>驅出羯磨者：白四羯磨。</lzh>
“A formal act of expulsion” means a formal act with a motion as fourth.

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼，突吉羅。</lzh>
For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>若病、若八難起、若非法羯磨，皆不犯。</lzh>
If she’s sick, if the eight difficulties arise, or if it was a formal act against dhamma, in all cases the offense isn’t committed.
