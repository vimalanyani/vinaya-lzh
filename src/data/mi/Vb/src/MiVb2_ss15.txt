<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時修休摩比丘尼、婆頗比丘尼，共作惡行，有惡名聲，乃至於佛法中增廣，得安樂住，亦如上說。二比丘尼言：「我等不作惡行，亦不觸惱眾僧。僧見我等羸弱，輕易我故，作如是語！」諸比丘尼復言：「汝等莫作是語！何以故？僧不見汝羸弱，輕易汝等。汝等自作惡行，觸惱眾僧，可相遠離，捨是作惡，觸惱僧事，於佛法中增廣，得安樂住！」如是諫，堅持不捨。諸長老比丘尼訶責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, Xiuxiumo bhikkhunī and Popo bhikkhunī engaged in unwholesome conduct together, had a bad reputation, … “You’ll grow in the Buddha’s dhamma and live comfortably,” as explained above. The two bhikkhunīs said: “We don’t engage in unwholesome conduct, and we also don’t irritate the sangha. The sangha sees us as weak, and they speak like this because they look down on us.” The bhikkhunīs said again: “Don’t say this! Why? The sangha doesn’t see you as weak and looks down on you. You engage in unwholesome conduct and irritate the sangha. Please live apart from each other, and give up this matter of practising the unwholesome and irritating the sangha. You’ll grow in the Buddha’s dhamma and live comfortably.” When they were admonished like this, they held firmly on to it and didn’t give it up. The senior bhikkhunīs criticized them … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus:


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若二比丘尼，共作惡行，有惡名聲，更相覆罪，觸惱眾僧。諸比丘尼語言：『汝二比丘尼莫共作惡行，有惡名聲，更相覆罪，觸惱眾僧。汝相遠離，捨是作惡觸惱僧事，於佛法中增廣，得安樂住！』二比丘尼言：『我等不作惡行，無惡名聲，不相覆罪，不觸惱僧。僧見我等羸弱，輕易我故，作如是語！』諸比丘尼復言：『莫作是語！何以故？僧不見汝羸弱，輕易汝等！汝等可相遠離，捨是作惡觸惱僧事，於佛法中增廣，得安樂住！』如是諫，堅持不捨，應第二、第三諫。第二、第三諫，捨是事善；不捨者，是比丘尼三諫，犯僧伽婆尸沙，可悔過。」</lzh>
‘If two bhikkhunīs engage in unwholesome conduct together, have a bad reputation, cover up each other’s offenses, and irritate the sangha, the bhikkhunīs should say: “You two bhikkhunīs, don’t engage in unwholesome conduct, have a bad reputation, cover up each other’s offenses, and irritate the sangha. Live apart from each other, and give up this matter of practising the unwholesome and irritating the sangha. You’ll grow in the Buddha’s dhamma and live comfortably.” If the two bhikkhunīs say: “We don’t engage in unwholesome conduct, there’s no bad reputation, we don’t cover up each other’s offenses, and don’t irritate the sangha. The sangha sees us as weak, and they speak like this because they look down on us,” the bhikkhunīs should say again: “Don’t say this! Why? The sangha doesn’t see you as weak and looks down on you. Please live apart from each other, and give up this matter of practising the unwholesome and irritating the sangha. You’ll grow in the Buddha’s dhamma and live comfortably.” If they, when admonished like this, hold firmly on to it and don’t give it up, they should admonish them a second and a third time. If they give up this matter at the second or third admonishment, it’s fine. If not, those bhikkhunīs commit a saṅghādisesa after three admonishments, from which one can repent.’”
