<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼，向諸白衣說諸比丘過失，言：「彼比丘破戒、破威儀、破見！」諸比丘聞便瞋，不復教誡。諸長老比丘尼聞，種種訶責，以事白佛。佛以是事集二部僧，問諸比丘尼：「汝等實爾不？」答言：「實爾。世尊！」佛種種訶責言：「我先不為汝說八敬法耶？」種種訶責已，告諸比丘：「今為諸比丘尼結戒，從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs told lay people of the bhikkhus’ faults: “This bhikkhu has broken the precepts, has broken proper conduct, has broken right view.” The bhikkhus heard it, were angry, and didn’t instruct them anymore. When the senior bhikkhunīs heard it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, and told the Buddha of this matter. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter and asked the bhikkhunīs: “Did you really do this?” They answered: “We really did it, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized them in all kinds of ways: “Haven’t I already taught you the eight rules of respect?” Having criticized them, he told the bhikkhus: “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus:


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，向白衣說比丘過，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī tells a lay person of a bhikkhu’s transgression, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼，突吉羅。</lzh>
For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>若白衣先聞而問，應反問言：「汝云何聞？」若言：「我如是如是聞！」諸比丘尼聞亦如是，然後以實答，不犯。</lzh>
If a lay person has heard it earlier and asks her, she should ask back: “What have you heard?” If they answer: “I’ve heard such-and-such,” and the bhikkhunīs have also heard it like this, she can then answer truthfully and the offense isn’t committed.
