<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時有夫婦二人，俱時出家，彼夫比丘乞食持還，至婦比丘尼住處食；其婦比丘尼捉水瓶立前，以扇扇之，與水，輒問冷暖。彼夫比丘低頭食，不視、不共語。彼比丘先白衣時，有私通女人亦出家，在彼住，來出見之，比丘便笑。其婦比丘尼嫉姤心發，即以水瓶打比丘頭破。諸比丘尼呵言：「云何比丘尼捉水瓶及扇，立比丘前給水及扇？遂復打其頭破！」諸長老比丘尼聞，種種呵責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, there was a couple of a husband and a wife who went forth at the same time. The husband bhikkhu went on almsround, and took (the food) back to his wife’s bhikkhunī residence to eat. His bhikkhunī wife took a water jug and stood in front of him. She fanned him with a fan, gave water, and then asked him if he was cold or hot. The husband bhikkhu ate with his head lowered, didn’t look at her, and didn’t talk with her. The woman whom the bhikkhu had earlier had an affair with when he had been a lay man, had also gone forth. She lived there, and came out to see him. The bhikkhu then laughed. Jealousy arose in his bhikkhunī wife’s mind, and she then hit the water jug on the bhikkhu’s head and broke it. The bhikkhunīs criticized her: “Why does a bhikkhunī take a water jug and a fan, stands in front of a bhikkhu, offers him water, and fans him? Thereupon, she also hit his head and broke (the jug).” When the senior bhikkhunīs heard it, they criticized her in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，捉水瓶及扇，立比丘前，若給水、若扇，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī takes a water jug or a fan, stands in front of a bhikkhu, and offers him water or fans him, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>若欲給水，與竟應遠去，不應住前立。</lzh>
If she wants to offer water, she should leave after giving it. She shouldn’t stand in front of him.

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼，突吉羅。</lzh>
For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.
