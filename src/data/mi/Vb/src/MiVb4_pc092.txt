<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼雖安居，於中遊行，遇賊火諸難。諸長老比丘尼見，種種訶責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, even though the bhikkhunīs entered the rains retreat, they went wandering during that time and encountered difficulties from criminals and fire. When the senior bhikkhunīs saw it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，於安居內遊行，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī wanders during the rains retreat, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>遊行者：若從一聚落至一聚落，若無聚落半由旬，波逸提。</lzh>
“Traveling” means if she goes from one village to another, or half a yojana where there’s no village, it’s a pācittiya.

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼，突吉羅。</lzh>
For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>若八難起，不犯。</lzh>
If the eight difficulties arise, the offense isn’t committed.
