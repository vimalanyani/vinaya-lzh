<lzh>爾時差摩比丘尼來至舍衛城，旃荼修摩那比丘尼以精舍借令住止。差摩得慈心三昧，有大威德，眷屬成就，旃荼弟子皆共尊重，並欲隨逐。旃荼覺之，便瞋罵言：「我以精舍借汝令住，反更誘人弟子！」諸長老比丘尼聞，種種呵責：「云何借他精舍，而後瞋謗？」乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, Khema bhikkhunī came to Sāvatthī, and Chandasumanā bhikkhunī lent her a monastery for her to stay. Khemā had attained compassion concentration, had great conduct and virtue, and her followers were accomplished. Chandā’s students all respected her, and wanted to follow her. When Chandā realized this, she angrily abused her: “I’ve lent you this monastery to stay, and in return you lure someone else’s students away!” When the senior bhikkhunīs heard it, they criticized her in all kinds of ways: “Why did you lend her the monastery, and later angrily slander her?” … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，先聽住，後瞋謗者，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī first allows someone to stay, and later angrily slanders her, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼，突吉羅。</lzh>
For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>若有實，而瞋恨，不犯。</lzh>
If it’s true and she’s angry, the offense isn’t committed.
