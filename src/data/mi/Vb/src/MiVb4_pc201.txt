<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼水中洗浴，逆流行，為水所觸，生愛欲心，遂致反俗、作外道者。諸長老比丘尼聞，種種呵責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs bathed in water and went against the current. They were touched by the water and sexual desire arose in their minds. Thereupon, they returned to lay life, or became non-Buddhist renunciates. When the senior bhikkhunīs heard it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，水中逆流行，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī goes against the current in water, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>若逆流行，步步波逸提；失不淨，偷羅遮。</lzh>
If she goes against the current, each step is a pācittiya. If she emits sexual fluid, it’s a thullaccaya.

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼，突吉羅。</lzh>
For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>若無欲心，不犯。</lzh>
If she doesn’t have a lustful mind, the offense isn’t committed.
