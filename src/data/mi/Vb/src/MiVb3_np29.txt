<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼多聚積器物，前後屋中，處處皆有；遇火燒屋，輦出諸物，無有極已。諸白衣救火見，問言：「此是誰物？」答：「是諸比丘尼物。」便譏訶言：「此輩大不吉利！於無為法中出家，著壞色割截衣，而聚積器物，如王大臣！常說少欲知足，而今藏積無厭！無沙門行，破沙門法！」諸長老比丘尼聞種種訶責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs accumulated many utensils. They were everywhere, inside the buildings from the front to the back. It happened that a fire burnt the building and they brought out these items in bundles. There was no end to it. The lay people put out the fire, saw it, and asked: “Whose items are these?” They answered: “These are the bhikkhunīs’ items.” Then they criticized them: “These people are greatly inauspicious. They haven’t gone forth in the dhamma. They wear a patchwork robe of stained colors, and accumulate utensils like a king or high official. They always say that they’ve few wishes and know moderation, but now they accumulate without limit. This isn’t the practice of renunciates. She has broken the rules of renunciates.” When the senior bhikkhunīs heard it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，藏積器物，尼薩耆波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī accumulates utensils, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>器物者：資生器物。唯聽畜盛酥、油、蜜、香、藥、醬、酢各一瓶；又聽畜釜、鎗、杓，各一，及一小瓮盛米食。過是畜，尼薩耆波逸提。</lzh>
“Utensils” means the utensils necessary for daily life. One may only keep one jug each containing ghee, oil, honey, perfume, medicine, bean paste, and vinegar. One may also keep one each of: a pot, a kettle, and a ladle; and a small jar containing rice to eat. If one keeps more, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.

For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.
