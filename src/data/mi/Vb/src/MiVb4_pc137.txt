<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時王園精舍前，地極平正，生軟好草，眾人常於中嬉戲，亂諸比丘尼坐禪行道。諸比丘尼厭患，便共於中大小便，污使不淨，以却眾人。眾人後來如常嬉戲，污其手脚、衣服、器物，便大恚言：「誰於此處，漫縱屎溺？」有人言：「是比丘尼！」皆譏訶言：「此等出家求道清淨，如何穢污如此好處，斷人樂事？」諸長老比丘尼聞，種種訶責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, in front of the monastery in the king’s park, the ground was very even, and soft, nice grass was growing. Many people often amused themselves there, and disturbed the bhikkhunīs sitting in meditation and practising the path. The bhikkhunīs became wearied, and then defecated and urinated there together, soiled it, and made it unclean, to drive away the groups of people. Later, many people came as usual to amuse themselves, and they soiled their hands, feet, clothes, and equipment, and said greatly angered: “Who has inundated this place with excrement and urine?” Someone told them: “The bhikkhunīs.” They all criticized them: “These renunciates seek the path and purity. Why did they pollute and soil such a nice place as this, and end people’s enjoyment?” When the senior bhikkhunīs heard it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，於生草上大小便，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī defecates or urinates on fresh grass, it’s a pācittiya.’”
