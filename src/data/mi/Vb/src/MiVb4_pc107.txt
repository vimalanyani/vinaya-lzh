<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼，雖滿十八歲童女，而女聾啞種種諸病，與受學戒，乃至今聽諸比丘尼白二羯磨，與滿十八歲童女受二歲學戒。
欲受學戒人，應到比丘尼僧中，白言：「阿姨僧聽！我某甲，和尚某甲，今從僧乞二歲學戒。善哉！阿姨僧與我受二歲學戒，憐愍故！」如是三乞已，諸比丘尼應善籌量，可與受、不可與受。應一比丘尼羯磨，依如上說。告諸比丘：「今為諸比丘尼結戒，從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>

Someone who wants to receive the training precepts should go into the midst of the bhikkhunī sangha and say: ‘Venerables, may the sangha listen. I, So-and-so, with So-and-so as my preceptor, now ask the sangha for the training precepts for two years.

One bhikkhunī should do a formal act, based on the explanation above.” He told the bhikkhus: “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，雖滿十八歲童女，僧不作羯磨，與受學戒，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī gives a girl the training precepts, even if she’s 18 years old, when the sangha hasn’t carried out a formal act, it’s a pācittiya.’”
