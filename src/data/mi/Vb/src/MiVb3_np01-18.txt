<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛城。爾時優波離問佛：「世尊已為諸比丘結戒：『若比丘，三衣竟，捨迦絺那衣已，長衣乃至十日；若過，尼薩耆波逸提。』乃至『若比丘，自捉金銀及錢，若使人捉、若發心受，尼薩耆波逸提。』我當云何持？」佛言：「應作二部僧持。從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
The Buddha was at Sāvatthī. At that time, Upāli asked the Buddha: “The World-honored One has laid down the precepts for the bhikkhus: ‘If a bhikkhu has finished his three robes and has relinquished the kaṭhina robe, (he may keep) a spare robe for up to 10 days. If he exceeds that, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.’ … ‘If a bhikkhu takes gold, silver, or money himself, or has others take it, or accepts it in his mind, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.’ How should I remember these?” The Buddha said: “You should remember them as to be practised by both sanghas. From now on, these precepts should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，三衣竟，捨迦絺那衣已，長衣乃至十日；若過，尼薩耆波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī has finished her three<note>The pātimokkha says “five”.</note> robes and has relinquished the kaṭhina robe, (she may keep) a spare robe for up to 10 days. If she exceeds that, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.

<lzh>「若比丘尼，衣竟，捨迦絺那衣已，五衣中若離一一衣宿，過一夜，除僧羯磨，尼薩耆波逸提。」</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī has finished her robes, has relinquished the kaṭhina robe, and stays away overnight from any of her five robes, when the night has passed, unless the sangha has carried out a formal act, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.

<lzh>「若比丘尼，衣竟，捨迦絺那衣已，得非時衣，若須應受，速作受持。若足者善；若不足，望更有得處，令具足成，乃至一月。若過，尼薩耆波逸提。」</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī has finished her robes, has relinquished the kaṭhina robe, and obtains out-of-season cloth, she should accept it if she needs it, quickly sew it, and determine it. If it’s enough, it’s fine. If it’s not enough and she hopes that there’s still a possibility to obtain more to complete it, (she may keep it) for up to one month. If she exceed that, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.

<lzh>「若比丘尼，從非親里居士、居士婦乞衣，除因緣，尼薩耆波逸提。因緣者：奪衣、失衣、燒衣、漂衣、衣壞，是名因緣。」</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī asks for a robe from an unrelated male or female householder, unless there’s a reason, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. “A reason” means that her robe has been stolen, lost, burnt, washed away, or is breaking up. This is called “a reason”.

<lzh>「若比丘尼，奪衣、失衣、燒衣、漂衣、衣壞，從非親里居士、居士婦乞衣。若居士、居士婦欲多與衣，是比丘尼應受二衣；若過是受，尼薩耆波逸提。」</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī, when her robe has been stolen, lost, burnt, washed away, or is breaking up, asks for a robe from an unrelated male or female householder, and if the male or female householder wants to give many robes, that bhikkhunī should accept two robes. If she accepts more than that, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.

<lzh>「若非親里居士、居士婦共議：『當以如是衣直作衣，與某甲比丘尼。』是比丘尼先不自恣請，便往問居士、居士婦言：『汝為我以如是衣直作衣不？』答言：『如是！』便言：『善哉，居士、居士婦！可作如是如是衣與我，為好故。』尼薩耆波逸提。</lzh>
If unrelated male or female householders say to each other: “With such-and-such a robe fund we’ll make a robe and give it to bhikkhunī So-and-so,” and if that bhikkhunī, without having been invited first, goes and asks these male or female householders: “Are you making a robe for me with such-and-such a robe fund?”, and they answer: “Yes,” and she then says: “It’d be good, male or female householders, if you made such-and-such a robe and give it to me,” in order to get something good, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.

<lzh>「若非親里居士、居士婦共議：『我當各以如是衣直作衣，與某甲比丘尼。』是比丘尼先不自恣請，便往問居士、居士婦言：『汝各為我以如是衣直作衣不？』答言：『如是！』便言：『善哉，居士、居士婦！可合作一衣與我，為好故。』尼薩耆波逸提。」</lzh>
If unrelated male or female householders say to each other: “With such-and-such a robe fund, we’ll each make a robe and give it to bhikkhunī So-and-so,” and if that bhikkhunī, without having been invited first, goes and asks these male or female householders: “Are you each making a robe for me with such-and-such a robe fund?”, and they answer: “Yes,” and she then says: “It’d be good, male or female householders, if you made one robe together and give it to me,” in order to get something good, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.

<lzh>「若王、若大臣、婆羅門、居士為比丘尼故，遣使送衣直。使到比丘尼所言：『阿姨！彼王、大臣送此衣直，阿姨受之！』是比丘尼言：『我不應受衣直。若得淨衣，當手受持。』使言：『阿姨！有執事人不？』比丘尼即指示處，使便到執事所，語言：『某王、大臣送此衣直，與某甲比丘尼。汝為受作，取便與之。』使既與已，還比丘尼所，白言：『阿姨！所示執事人，我已與竟。阿姨須衣，便可往取！』是比丘尼二反、三反到執事所，作是言：『我須衣，我須衣。』若得者善；若不得，四反、五反、六反到執事前，默然立，若得者善。若過是求得者，尼薩耆波逸提。若不得衣，應隨使來處，若自往、若遣信，語言：『汝為某甲比丘尼送衣直，是比丘尼竟不得；汝自還索，莫使失！』是事應爾。」</lzh>
If a king, a high official, a brahmin, or a householder sends a messenger with a robe fund for a bhikkhunī, and if that messenger goes to the bhikkhunī and says: “Venerable, that king or a high official sends this robe fund. The venerable should accept it,” the bhikkhunī might say: “I shouldn’t accept a robe fund. If I obtain a pure robe, I’ll accept it with my hands and keep it.” If the messenger says: “Venerable, do you have a manager?”, and the bhikkhunī then indicates a place, the messenger might go to the manager and say: “King or high official So-and-so sends this robe fund for bhikkhunī So-and-so. Accept and arrange it, take it and then give it to her.” If the messenger, after having given it, returns to the bhikkhunī and tells her: “Venerable, I’ve given it to the manager you pointed out. When the venerable needs a robe, you can go there and take one,” and that bhikkhunī goes to the manager two or three times and says: “I need a robe, I need a robe,” and if she obtains it, it’s fine. If she doesn’t obtain it, she may go and stand silently in front of the manager for four, five, or six times. If she obtains it, it’s fine. If she tries to obtain the robe more times, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. If she doesn’t obtain the robe, she should either go herself to the place from where the messenger came, or send a message to say: “You sent a robe fund for bhikkhunī So-and-so. That bhikkhunī didn’t obtain it in the end. You should request a refund, don’t let it be lost.” This matter should (be handled) thus.

<lzh>「若比丘尼，自行乞縷，雇織師織作衣，尼薩耆波逸提。」</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī goes and asks for thread herself, and employs a weaver to weave a robe, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.

<lzh>「若居士、居士婦，為比丘尼使織師織作衣。是比丘尼先不自恣請，便到織師所，作是言：『汝知不？此衣為我作，汝為我好織，令極緻廣，當別相報。』後若與一食、若一食直，得者，尼薩耆波逸提。」</lzh>
If a male or female householder has a weaver weave a robe for a bhikkhunī, and if that bhikkhunī, without having been invited first, goes to that weaver and says: “Do you know that this robe is made for me? Weave it well for me to make it very fine and wide. I’ll give you additional compensation,” and if she later gives a meal, or funds for a meal, and obtains (the robe), it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.

<lzh>「若比丘尼，與比丘尼衣，後瞋不喜，若自奪、若使人奪，作是語：『還我衣，不與汝！』尼薩耆波逸提。」</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī gives a robe to another bhikkhunī, and if later, angry and dissatisfied, she either snatches it back herself or has others snatch it back, and says: “Return my robe, I didn’t give it to you,” it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.

<lzh>「若比丘尼，知檀越欲與僧物，迴以入己，尼薩耆波逸提。」</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī knows that a supporter wants to give an item to the sangha, and diverts it to herself, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.

<lzh>「若比丘尼，病得服四種含消藥：酥、油、蜜、石蜜，一受乃至七日。若過，尼薩耆波逸提。」</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī is sick, she may take four kinds of oral medicines: ghee, oil, honey, and sugar, and once received keep them for up to seven days. If she exceeds that, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.

<lzh>「若比丘尼，前後安居，十日未至自恣，得急施衣；若須應受，乃至衣時。若過，尼薩耆波逸提。」</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī, during the earlier or the later rains retreat, 10 days before the invitation ceremony, obtains an urgent offer of a robe, she should accept it if she needs it, (and keep it) throughout the robe season. If she exceeds that, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.

<lzh>「若比丘尼，鉢未滿五綴，更乞新鉢，為好故，尼薩耆波逸提。」</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī, whose bowl has less than five repairs, still asks for a new bowl, in order to get something good, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.

<lzh>「若比丘尼，種種販賣求利，尼薩耆波逸提。」</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī seeks profits with all kinds of sales, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.

<lzh>「若比丘尼，以金銀及錢，種種賣買，尼薩耆波逸提。」</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī engages in all kinds of trades with gold, silver, or money, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.

<lzh>「若比丘尼，自捉金銀及錢，若使人捉、若發心受，尼薩耆波逸提(十八)。」</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī takes gold, silver, or money herself, or has others take it, or accepts it in her mind, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.’” (18.)
