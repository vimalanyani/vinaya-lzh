<h2>Origin Stories</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼剃二處毛：腋下、隱處，生愛欲心，遂有反俗、作外道者。</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs shaved the hair in two places: under the armpits, and in the hidden place, and sexual desire arose in their minds. Thereupon they returned to lay life, or became non-Buddhist renunciates.

<lzh>時偷羅難陀亦自剃隱處毛，其主人家嫁女，女欲見之，便遣信呼，比丘尼即往。時家為女作浴，女言：「先使比丘尼浴！」即呼令浴，答言：「我不須浴！」諸女人便強脫衣令浴，因見其剃隱處毛，即問：「阿姨何故剃此？」便反問言：「汝等何以剃之？」諸女言：「我為男子故！」比丘尼言：「我亦如是！」諸女便譏訶言：「此等常毀訾欲，而今作如是事，不修梵行！何不還俗，自恣五欲？無沙門行，破沙門法！」諸長老比丘尼聞，種種訶責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
Then Thullanandā also shaved the hair in the hidden place. The women in her supporter’s house wanted to see it and sent a message to summon her. The bhikkhunī then went there. The the household prepared a bath for the women, and one woman said: “Let’s first have the bhikkhunī bathe.” Then they summoned her to make her bathe. She answered: “I don’t need to bathe.” The women then removed her robes by force to make her bathe, and therefore they saw that she had shaved the hair in the hidden place. Then they asked: “Venerable, why did you shave this?” She asked back: “Why do you shave there?” The women said: “We do it for a man.” The bhikkhunī said: “I also do it for that.” The women criticized her: “They always speak ill of desire, and now, she does such things and doesn’t practise celibacy! Why doesn’t she return to lay life and indulge in the five pleasures? This isn’t the practice of renunciates. She has broken the rules of renunciates.” When the senior bhikkhunīs heard it, they criticized her in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，剃腋下、隱處毛，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī shaves the hair under the armpits and in the hidden place, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>若剃，刀刀波逸提。</lzh>
If she shaves, each stroke with the blade is a pācittiya.

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼，突吉羅。</lzh>
For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>若為生瘡須剃，若人強捉剃，皆不犯。</lzh>
If she need to shave because an abscess is growing there, or if someone holds her by force and shaves her, in both cases the offense isn’t committed.
