<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時差摩比丘尼到舍衛城，旃茶修摩那比丘尼語言：「我當囑主人，令看視汝！」差摩言：「不須汝囑！」旃荼修摩那復言：「汝受我囑，既得利養，又福度彼！」於是差摩默然許之，彼即將到諸家。差摩比丘尼有大眷屬，行慈心三昧，莫不宗敬，無復供養旃荼修摩那比丘尼，便生嫉妬心言：「我囑諸家令彼多得供養，而彼反更道說我惡，使我不復得食！」諸比丘尼種種訶責言：「云何比丘尼護惜他家？」諸長老比丘尼聞，種種訶責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, Khemā bhikkhunī had arrived in Sāvatthī, and Chandasumanā bhikkhunī said: “I’ll inform the supporters and have them visit you.” Khemā said: “You don’t need to inform them.” Chandasumanā said again: “Accept that I inform them, and thus obtain benefits, and also have merits to transfer to them.” At that, Khemā allowed it by being silent. She then took her to the families. Khemā bhikkhunī had many disciples, she practised compassion samādhi, and there was nobody who didn’t respect her as a role model. They didn’t support Chandasumanā bhikkhunī anymore, and jealousy then arose in her mind. She said: “I informed these families, by which she obtained much support. But she on the other hand speaks badly of me, and causes me to not obtain food anymore.” The bhikkhunīs criticized her in all kinds of ways: “Why does a bhikkhunī keep families to herself?” When the senior bhikkhunīs heard it, they criticized her in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，護惜他家，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī keeps families to herself, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>護惜他家者：欲使他家供養己，不供養餘人。</lzh>
“Keeping families to herself” means that she wants to have these families support herself and not support others.
