<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼於國內恐怖處行，無救護者，為惡人剝奪。諸長老比丘尼見，種種訶責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs were wandering in a frightening place within their country without anyone to protect them, and were robbed by evil people. When the senior bhikkhunīs saw it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，於國內恐怖處，無所依怙而獨行者，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī wanders alone without someone to rely on in a frightening place within her country, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>雖眾多比丘尼共行，而無白衣強伴，名為獨行。</lzh>
Even if many bhikkhunīs wander together, if they’ve no strong lay companion, it’s called “wandering alone”.

<lzh>從一聚落至一聚落，若無聚落行半由旬，波逸提。</lzh>
If she goes from one village to another, or if she wanders half a yojana where there’s no village, it’s a pācittiya.

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼，突吉羅。</lzh>
For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>若急難，叛走，皆不犯。</lzh>
If she’s in immediate difficulties, or if (the companion) leaves her, in both cases the offense isn’t committed.
