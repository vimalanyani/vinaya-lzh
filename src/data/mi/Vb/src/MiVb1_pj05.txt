<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時毘舍佉婿，名鹿子。鹿子敬毘舍佉，猶如敬母，時人遂名為毘舍佉鹿子母。其孫名尸利跋，尸利跋常繫念於偷羅難陀比丘尼，後請比丘尼僧，偷羅難陀託病不往，共一小沙彌尼坐守僧房。時到，比丘尼僧皆詣其家，尸利跋手自下食，問言：「偷羅難陀何故不來？」諸比丘尼答言：「以其病，僧差守房，是故不來。」彼下上坐食已，便馳往問：「何所患苦？」答言：「骨節皆痛！」彼即為按摩。比丘尼言：「聽汝處處按摩，但不得行欲！」既按摩已，問言：「汝須何物？」答言：「我須乾棗。」便買與之。</lzh>
At that time, Visākhā’s son-in-law was called Migāraputta. Migāraputta respected Visākhā as one respects a mother. Then people started to call Visākhā “Migāraputta’s mother.” Her grandson was called Sāḷha. Sāḷha often attached his mind to Thullanandā bhikkhunī. Later, he invited the bhikkhunī sangha. Thullanandā pretended to be sick and didn’t go. She sat and guarded the sangha building together with a small sāmaṇerī. When the time had come, the bhikkhunī sangha came to his house, and Sāḷha gave out the food with his own hands and asked: “Why didn’t Thullanandā come?” The bhikkhunīs answered: “Because she’s sick, the sangha has assigned her to guard the building, therefore she didn’t come.” When he had given food to the senior bhikkhunī, he rushed (to Thullanandā) and asked: “From what do you suffer?” She answered: “My bones and joint are all painful.” He then massaged her. The bhikkhunī said: “I allow you to massage me everywhere, but you may not engage in desire.” When he had massaged her, he asked: “What item do you need?” She answered: “I need a dried jujube.” He bought it and gave it to her.
<lzh>比丘尼以手捧棗，問言：「汝見是乾棗不？」答言：「見！」比丘尼言：「若人繫心於不可行欲處，神明乾縮亦如此也！」於是尸利跋與此比丘尼種種身相觸已，便出。諸比丘尼食還，入門遙見，咸疑已共偷羅難陀作不淨行，問言：「汝已破梵行耶？」答言：「我不破梵行，唯與男子身相觸耳！」小沙彌尼亦云：「如此！」諸比丘尼種種呵責言：「佛種種毀訾與男子身相觸，種種讚歎不觸男子身！汝今云何作此惡事？」訶已，往到佛所，以事白佛。佛以是事集二部僧，問偷羅難陀：「汝實爾不？」答言：「實爾。世尊！」佛如上種種訶責已，告諸比丘：「以十利故，今為諸比丘尼結戒，從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
The bhikkhunī took up a jujube in her hands and asked: “Do you see this dried jujube?” He answered: “I see it.” The bhikkhunī said: “If people attach their mind to something where they can’t act out their desire, their spiritual brilliance also dies up and shrivels like this.” At this, Sāḷha and this bhikkhunī touched each other’s bodies in various ways and then he left. The bhikkhunīs returning from the meal saw him from the distance when they entered the gate, and they all doubted whether he did the impure act with Thullanandā. They asked: “Have you broken celibacy?” She answered: “I haven’t broken celibacy, I and a man just touched each other’s bodies.” The small sāmaṇerī also said: “It was like this.” The bhikkhunīs criticized her in all kinds of ways: “The Buddha has disparaged in all kinds of ways the touching of each other’s bodies with a man, and he has praised in all kinds of ways not touching a man’s body. Why did you now do this bad thing?” Having criticized her, they went to the Buddha and told him of this matter. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter and asked Thullanandā: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” When the Buddha had criticized her in all kinds of ways as above, he told the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus:

<h2>Final Ruling</h2></h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，欲盛變心，受男子種種摩觸：髮際已下，膝已上，肘已後。是比丘尼得波羅夷，不共住。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī in a mindstate altered by abundant desire, lets a man rub and touch her in all kinds of ways below the hairline, above the knees, and above the elbows, that bhikkhunī incurs a pārājika, and doesn’t live in community.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼者：白四羯磨受具足戒。</lzh>
“A bhikkhunī” means someone who has received the full ordination in a formal act with a motion as fourth.

<lzh>釋欲盛變心已下，如比丘觸女人身戒中說。</lzh>
The explanation from “a mindstate altered by abundant desire” onwards is as explained in the precept of “a bhikkhu touching a woman’s body”.
