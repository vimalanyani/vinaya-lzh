<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>優波離又問：「世尊已為諸比丘結戒：『若比丘，助破和合僧，乃至僧伽婆尸沙。』我當云何持？」佛言：「應作二部僧持。從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
Upāli asked again: “The World-honored One has laid down the precept for the bhikkhus: ‘If bhikkhus help to split the sangha in harmony, … it’s a saṅghādisesa.’ How should I remember this?” The Buddha said: “You should remember it as to be practised by both sanghas. From now on, this precept should be recited thus:


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，助破和合僧，若一、若二、若眾多，語諸比丘尼言：『是比丘尼所說，是知說，非不知說；說法，不說非法；說律，不說非律，皆是我等心所忍樂。』諸比丘尼語是比丘尼：『汝莫作是語：「是比丘尼所說，是知說，非不知說；說法，不說非法；說律，不說非律，皆是我等心所忍樂。」何以故？是比丘尼非知說、非說法、非說律。汝莫樂助破和合僧，當樂助和合僧。僧和合故，歡喜無諍，一心一學，如水乳合，共弘師教，安樂行。』如是諫，堅持不捨，應第二、第三諫。第二、第三諫，捨是事善；不捨者，是比丘尼三諫，犯僧伽婆尸沙，可悔過。」</lzh>
‘If bhikkhunīs help to split the sangha in harmony, one, two or many, and say to the bhikkhunīs: “What that bhikkhunī says is said with knowledge, not without knowledge; she speaks dhamma, not contrary to dhamma; she speaks vinaya, not contrary to vinaya. Our minds accept and delight in everything,” the other bhikkhunīs should say to these bhikkhunīs: “Don’t say this: ‘What that bhikkhunī says is said with knowledge, not without knowledge; she speaks dhamma, not contrary to dhamma; she speaks vinaya, not contrary to vinaya. Our minds accept and delight in everything.’ Why? That bhikkhunī speaks without knowledge, contrary to dhamma, and contrary to vinaya. Don’t delight in helping to split the sangha in harmony. You should delight in helping the sangha in harmony. Because a sangha is in harmony, they’re happy, don’t quarrel, they’re of one mind and one training, mixing like water and milk, spreading the master’s teaching together, and living comfortably.” If they, when admonished like this, hold firmly on to it and don’t give it up, they should admonish them a second and a third time. If they give up this matter at the second or third admonishment, it’s fine. If not, those bhikkhunīs commit a saṅghādisesa after three admonishments, from which one can repent.’”
