<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時優波離問佛：「世尊已為諸比丘結應學法：『不高著下衣，應當學。』乃至『樹過人，不得上，除大因緣，應當學。』我當云何持？」佛言：「應作二部僧持。從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, Upāli asked the Buddha: “The World-honored One has laid down the training precepts for the bhikkhus: ‘Not to wear the lower robe too high should be trained.’ … ‘One may not climb up a tree that’s taller than a person, unless there’s a very good reason, should be trained.’ How should I remember these?” The Buddha said: “You should remember them as to be practised by both sanghas. From now on, these precepts should be recited thus:
