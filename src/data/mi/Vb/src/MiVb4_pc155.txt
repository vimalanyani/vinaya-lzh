<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼畜華鬘、或著，生染著心，不樂修梵行，遂致反俗、作外道者。諸長老比丘尼見，種種呵責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs kept flower garlands. Some wore them, and sexual desire arose in their minds. They weren’t happy to practise celibacy, and thereupon returned to lay life, or became non-Buddhist renunciates. When the senior bhikkhunīs saw it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，畜華鬘、若著，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī keeps a flower garland or wears it, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>乃至以草葉係頭為好，皆名著華鬘。</lzh>
Even just tying grass and leaves to the head to look good, all is called “wearing flower garlands”.

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼，突吉羅。</lzh>
For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>若強力所逼，不犯。</lzh>
If she’s forced, the offense isn’t committed.
