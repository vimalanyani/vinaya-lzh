<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時優波離復問佛：「世尊已為諸比丘結戒：『若比丘，若人、若似人，若自殺，乃至不共住。』我當云何持？」佛言：「應作二部僧持。從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>

‘If a bhikkhunī kills a human being or a human-like being, either herself, or by giving them a knife or poison, or by instructing people to kill, or by instructing people to commit suicide, praising and commending death: “Hey you, what use is this bad life? Death is better than living on!”, thus creating such intentions and following them to kill, and if someone dies because of these various causes, that bhikkhunī incurs a pārājika, and doesn’t live in community.’”
