<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時毘舍佉母請比丘尼僧，與遮月水衣，遣信索身量，即皆與之；唯偷羅難陀不與，更遣信索，答言：「我已離欲，無復月水，不須此衣。」毘舍佉母作衣竟，遣信白諸比丘尼：「衣已竟，願各來取！」諸比丘尼皆往就坐。時偷羅難陀月水正出，便先取衣。諸比丘尼次第取之，衣少不足，下坐一人不得。毘舍佉母問：「盡得衣不？」答言：「下坐一人不得。」問：「何以故？」答言：「偷羅難陀先言不須，不付身量。今便先取，是以不足。」毘舍佉母言：「云何先言不須，臨時便取，令他不得？」諸長老比丘尼種種訶責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, mother Visākhā invited the bhikkhunī sangha and offered robes to absorb the menstrual fluid. She send a messenger to ask for their bodies’ measurements and everyone gave hers. Only Thullanandā didn’t give hers, and when the messenger asked, she answered: “I’m already free from desire, I don’t menstruate anymore, and don’t need this robe.” When mother Visākhā had finished the robes, the messenger told the bhikkhunīs: “The robes are ready, may everyone come and take hers.” The bhikkhunīs then all went there and sat down. Then Thullanandā’s menstrual fluid actually came out, and she was the first to take a robe. The bhikkhunīs took one in order of seniority, and the robes weren’t enough. The most junior one didn’t obtain one. Mother Visākhā asked: “Has everyone obtained a robe?” They answered: “The most junior one hasn’t obtained one.” She asked: “Why?” They answered: “Thullanandā first said that she didn’t need one, and didn’t provide her body’s measurements. Today, she was the first to take one, and so it wasn’t enough.” Mother Visākhā said: “Why did you first say you didn’t need one, and when the time came, you still took one, so that someone didn’t obtain one?” 
The senior bhikkhunīs criticized her in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，諸比丘尼語：『汝取遮月水衣。』自言不用，臨時先取，尼薩耆波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī is told by the bhikkhunīs: “Take a robe to absorb the menstrual fluid”, says: “I don’t use it”, and when the time comes takes it first, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>此衣應僧中捨，不得與一、二、三比丘尼。</lzh>
This robe should be relinquished in the sangha. It may not be given to one, two, or three bhikkhunīs.

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼，突吉羅。</lzh>
For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>先雖言不用，最後有長而取，不犯。</lzh>
Even if she first says “I don’t use it”, if later there are spare ones and she takes one, the offense isn’t committed.
