<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼教誡時不往聽，羯磨時亦不往聽，便愚闇無知不能學戒。諸長老比丘尼種種訶責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs didn’t go and listen at the time of instruction. And they also didn’t go and listen at the time of doing formal acts. Then they were ignorant and without knowledge, and unable to train in the precepts. The senior bhikkhunīs criticized them in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，教誡及羯磨時，不往聽，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī doesn’t go and listen at the time of instruction and of doing formal acts, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

“Instruction” means explaining the eight rules of respect.

<lzh>羯磨者：白羯磨、白二、白四羯磨。</lzh>
