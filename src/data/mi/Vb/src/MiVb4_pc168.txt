<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時跋陀伽毘羅比丘尼髀裏生癰，不白僧，輒使男子醫破，出膿、洗訖布藥。諸長老比丘尼見，呵責言：「汝已離欲，故可如此！若未離欲人，不當犯大事耶？」乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, an abscess grew on the inside of Bhaddā Kāpilānī’s thigh. Without informing the sangha, she just had a male doctor open it, remove the pus, wash it, and apply medicine. When the senior bhikkhunīs saw it, they criticized her: “You’re already free from desire, therefore you can do this! If you weren’t yet free from desire, wouldn’t you’ve committed a great offense?” … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，不白僧，輒使男子治病，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī without informing the sangha, just has a man treat an illness, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>若欲令男子治病，應打犍稚集僧，來在病人前，然後衣裹身體，唯留可應治處。</lzh>
If she wants to have a man treat an illness, she should strike the bell to gather the sangha. When he comes to the sick person, she should wrap her body with a robe and just leave the place that needs treatment open.

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼，突吉羅。</lzh>
For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>若使女人治，不犯。</lzh>
If she has a woman treat it, the offense isn’t committed.
