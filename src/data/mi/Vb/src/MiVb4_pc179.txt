<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼不禮比丘，不迎不送，亦不請坐。諸比丘瞋，不復教誡，諸比丘尼愚闇無知不能學戒。諸長老比丘尼見，種種呵責，以是白佛。佛以是事集二部僧，問諸比丘尼：「汝等實爾不？」答言：「實爾。世尊！」佛種種呵責言：「我先不說八敬法，應禮比丘耶？從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs didn’t pay respect to bhikkhus, didn’t welcome them, didn’t send them off, and didn’t ask them to sit down. The bhikkhus were angry and didn’t instruct them anymore. The bhikkhunīs were ignorant and without knowledge, and not able to train in the precepts. When the senior bhikkhunīs saw it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, and told the Buddha of this. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter and asked the bhikkhunīs: “Did you really do this?” They answered: “We really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized them in all kinds of ways: “Haven’t I already taught the eight rules of respect: You should pay respect to bhikkhus? From now on, this precept should be recited thus:


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，見比丘不起、不禮、不請坐，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī sees a bhikkhu and doesn’t get up, doesn’t pay respect, and doesn’t ask him to sit down, it’s a pācittiya.’”
