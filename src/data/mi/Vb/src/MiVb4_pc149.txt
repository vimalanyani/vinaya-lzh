<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼，與白衣及外道婦女同衣臥，身體相觸，生愛欲心，不樂梵行，遂致反俗、作外道者。諸婦女後隨知識，語言：「某甲比丘尼身體，有如是如是好！」諸白衣後見比丘尼，便指弄言：「好身體者，此比丘尼是！彼比丘尼是！」諸比丘尼以此羞恥。諸長老比丘尼聞，種種呵責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs lay down with lay women and non-Buddhist female renunciates on the same robe. Their bodies touched each other, and sexual desire arose in their minds. They weren’t happy with celibacy, and thereupon returned to lay life, or became non-Buddhist renunciates. As the lay women had got to know them, they later said: “Bhikkhunī So-and-so’s body is really so nice.” When they lay people later saw the bhikkhunīs, they pointed at them, fooled around, and said: “What a nice body this bhikkhunī has, or that bhikkhunī has.” The bhikkhunīs became ashamed by this. When the senior bhikkhunīs heard it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，共白衣及外道婦女同衣臥，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī lies down with a lay woman or a non-Buddhist female renunciate on the same robe, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>若同床共被，內衣應使有隔。</lzh>
If they’re on the same bed with a common blanket, she should use the lower robe to separate them.

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼，突吉羅。</lzh>
For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.
