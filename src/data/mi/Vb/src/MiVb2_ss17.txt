<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時旃荼修摩那比丘尼好共他鬪，僧斷其事，便瞋恚言：「我捨佛、捨法、捨僧、捨戒作外道。餘沙門、婆羅門，亦學戒、亦慚愧，我當於彼淨修梵行！」諸比丘尼語言：「汝莫好共他鬪，莫作是語：『我捨佛，乃至於彼淨修梵行！』何以故？餘沙門、婆羅門，無學戒、無慚愧，汝云何於彼得修梵行？汝捨是惡見，於佛法中增廣，得安樂住！」如是諫，堅持不捨，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, Chandasumanā bhikkhunī often quarreled with others, and when the sangha had settled matters, she angrily said: “I renounce the Buddha, I renounce the dhamma, I renounce the sangha. I renounce the precepts and will become a non-Buddhist renunciate. Other renunciates and brahmins also train in precepts and have shame. I’ll practise the monastic life in purity with them.” The bhikkhunīs said: “Don’t often quarrel with others, and don’t say: ‘I renounce the Buddha, … practise the monastic life in purity with them.’ Why? Other renunciates and brahmins don’t train in precepts and don’t have shame. How would you be able to practise the monastic life with them? Give up this wrong view. You’ll grow in the Buddha’s dhamma and live comfortably.” When she was admonished like this, she held firmly on to it and didn’t give it up. … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus:


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，好共他鬪，僧斷其事，便言：『我捨佛、捨法、捨僧、捨戒作外道。餘沙門、婆羅門，亦學戒、亦慚愧，我當於彼淨修梵行！』諸比丘尼語言：『汝莫好共他鬪，莫作是語：「我捨佛法僧！」何以故？餘沙門、婆羅門，無學戒、無慚愧，汝云何於彼得修梵行？汝捨是惡見，於佛法中增廣，得安樂住！』如是諫，堅持不捨，應第二、第三諫。第二、第三諫，捨是事善；不捨者，是比丘尼三諫已，犯僧伽婆尸沙，可悔過。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī often quarrels with others, and when the sangha has settled matters, says: “I renounce the Buddha, I renounce the dhamma, I renounce the sangha. I renounce the precepts and will become a non-Buddhist renunciate. Other renunciates and brahmins also train in precepts and have shame. I’ll practise the monastic life in purity with them,” the bhikkhunīs should say: “Don’t often quarrel with others, and don’t say: ‘I renounce the Buddha, the dhamma, and the sangha.’ Why? Other renunciates and brahmins don’t train in precepts and don’t have shame. How would you be able to practise the monastic life with them? Give up this wrong view. You’ll grow in the Buddha’s dhamma and live comfortably.” If she, when admonished like this, holds firmly on to it and doesn’t give it up, they should admonish her a second and a third time. If she gives up this matter at the second or third admonishment, it’s fine. If not, that bhikkhunī commits a saṅghādisesa after three admonishments, from which one can repent.’”
