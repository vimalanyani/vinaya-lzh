<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼，與未滿十二歲已嫁女受具足戒，愚闇無知不堪學戒。諸長老比丘尼見，種種訶責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs gave married women who weren’t yet 12 years old the full ordination. They were ignorant and without knowledge, and couldn’t bear to train in the precepts. When the senior bhikkhunīs saw it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，與未滿十二歲已嫁女受具足戒，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī gives a married woman who isn’t yet 12 years old the full ordination, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>未滿十二歲者：雖已嫁，而未滿十二歲。</lzh>
“Not yet 12 years old” means even though she’s already married, she’s not yet 12 years old.

<lzh>嫁者：已經男子。</lzh>
“Married” means already having experience with a man. 

<lzh>餘如上畜眷屬中說。</lzh>
The remainder is as explained above in “taking on a disciple”.
