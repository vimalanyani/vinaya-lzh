<h2>Origin Stories</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼以手拍女根，生愛欲心，遂有反俗、作外道者。</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs patted their vagina with their hands, and sexual desire arose in their minds. Thereupon they returned to lay life, or became non-Buddhist renunciates.

<lzh>偷羅難陀亦以手拍女根，女根大腫，不能復行，弟子為到常供養家云：「師病，為索食！」彼即與之。其家婦女尋來問訊，言：「阿姨何所患苦？」答言：「我病！」又問：「是何等病？同是女人，何以不道？」便具以事答。於是諸女譏訶言：「此等常毀訾欲、欲想、欲熱、欲覺，而今作如此事！何不罷道，受五欲樂？無沙門行，破沙門法！」諸長老比丘尼聞，種種訶責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
Thullanandā also patted her vagina with her hand. Her vagina greatly swelled up and she couldn’t walk anymore. Her student went to the house of regular supporters and said: “My teacher is sick, I’m asking for food for her.” They then gave some, and the women of the household came and inquired after her: “Venerable, from what do you suffer?” She answered: “I’m sick.” They asked again: “Which sickness is it? We’re among women, why don’t you tell us?” Then she explained this matter in full. At this, the women criticized her: “They always speak ill of desire, of thoughts of desire, of the heat of desire, and of the sensations of desire. And now, she does such things! Why doesn’t she disrobe and experience the happiness of the five pleasures? This isn’t the practice of renunciates. She has broken the rules of renunciates.” When the senior bhikkhunīs heard it, they criticized her in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，以手拍女根，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī pats the vagina with her hand, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>若以手拍，拍拍波逸提；出不淨，偷羅遮。</lzh>
If she pats with the hand, each pat is a pācittiya. If sexual fluids come out, it’s a thullaccaya.

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼，突吉羅。</lzh>
For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>(七十竟)</lzh>
(End of 70.)<note>This is actually the 71st precept. The numbering is out of alignment, because precept no. 36 is missing in the vibhaṅga, but included in the pātimokkha.</note>
