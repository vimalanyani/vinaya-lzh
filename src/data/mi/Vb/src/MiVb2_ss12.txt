<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>優波離又問：「世尊已為諸比丘結戒：『若比丘，惡性，難共語，與諸比丘同學戒經，數數犯罪，乃至僧伽婆尸沙。』我當云何持？」佛言：「當作二部僧持。從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
Upāli asked again: “The World-honored One has laid down the precept for the bhikkhus: ‘If a bhikkhu is of bad character and difficult to talk to, while training in the precepts sutta together with the other bhikkhus, he often commits offenses, … it’s a saṅghādisesa.’ How should I remember this?” The Buddha said: “You should remember it as to be practised by both sanghas. From now on, this precept should be recited thus:


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，惡性，難共語，與諸比丘尼同學戒經，數數犯罪。諸比丘尼如法如律諫其所犯，答言：『阿姨！汝莫語我若好、若惡；我亦不以好、惡語汝。』諸比丘尼復語言：『汝莫作自我不可共語！汝當為諸比丘尼說如法語，諸比丘尼亦當為汝說如法語；如是展轉相教，轉相出罪，成如來眾。』如是諫，堅持不捨，應第二、第三諫；第二、第三諫，捨是事善；若不捨者，是比丘尼三諫，犯僧伽婆尸沙，可悔過。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī is of bad character and difficult to talk to, while training in the precepts sutta together with the other bhikkhunīs, she often commits offenses, and when the bhikkhunīs admonish her about her offenses according to dhamma and vinaya, she answers: “Venerables, don’t talk to me about good and bad. I’ll also not talk to you about good or bad,” the bhikkhunīs should say again: “Don’t make yourself unadressable by others. You should speak with the bhikkhunīs according to dhamma, and the bhikkhunīs will also speak with you according to dhamma. In this way, we teach each other, we rehabilitate each other from offenses, and perfect the Tathāgata’s assembly.” If she, when admonished like this, holds firmly on to it and doesn’t give it up, they should admonish her a second and a third time. If she gives up this matter at the second or third admonishment, it’s fine. If not, that bhikkhunī commits a saṅghādisesa after three admonishments, from which one can repent.’”
