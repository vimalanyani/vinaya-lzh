<h2>First Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼或以一指，乃至五指內女根中洗，傷肉血出，以此致病。諸長老比丘尼見，種種訶責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, some of the bhikkhunīs inserted one finger … five fingers into the vagina to wash it. They injured the tissue and blood came out. Because of this, they became sick. When the senior bhikkhunīs saw it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Preliminary Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，以水洗女根，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī washes her vagina with water, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Second Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛既不聽洗，便臭穢不淨，熱時生蟲。波闍波提比丘尼與五百比丘尼俱至佛所，白佛言：「世尊！我等女人形體臭穢，正賴水洗，願見聽許！」佛告諸比丘：「今聽諸比丘尼以水作淨。」佛既聽已，復如前法，諸比丘尼見，種種訶責，乃至告諸比丘，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
As the Buddha hadn’t allowed to wash, it then stank and was dirty and unclean. During summer, insects emerged. Pajāpatī bhikkhunī, together with 500 bhikkhunīs, went to the Buddha, and told him: “World-honored One, our woman’s body stinks and is dirty. It’s proper to wash it with water. Please see to allowing it.” The Buddha told the bhikkhus: “I now allow that the bhikkhunīs clean themselves with water.” When the Buddha had allowed it, things happened again as before. When the bhikkhunīs saw it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, … he told the bhikkhus, as explained above. “From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，以水洗女根，應用二指齊一節；若過，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī washes her vagina with water, she should use the first joint of two fingers. If she exceeds that, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼，突吉羅。</lzh>
For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>若根內生瘡、若有蟲入、若草石入，用指過一節，不犯。</lzh>
If an abscess grows inside her vagina, if insects enter, or if grass or a stone enters, and she uses more than the first joint of the fingers, the offense isn’t committed.
