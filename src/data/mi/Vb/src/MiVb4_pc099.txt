<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼看王宮殿及看畫舍，又遊觀諸嬉戲處；到華池上，彼處多人聚看，比丘尼語諸男子言：「汝可小避，莫逼近我！」諸男子言：「不吉利人！剃頭著割截衣，不應來此；而來此者，是欲求男子！云何使我避去？」便捉牽曳，作麁惡婬欲語。諸長老比丘尼聞，種種訶責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs visited kings’ palaces and galleries, and they also went sightseeing in places of entertainment. They came to a flower pond, and many people had gathered in that place to see it. The bhikkhunīs told the men: “Please keep away a little, don’t come close to us.” The men said: “Inauspicious people, having shaven your head and put on patchwork robes, you shouldn’t come here. But you’ve come here, because you want to look for a man. Why do you make us keep away?” Then they took hold of them, dragged them away, and spoke coarse, unwholesome words about sexual desire. When the senior bhikkhunīs heard it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，種種遊看，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī wanders around for all kinds of sightseeing, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>發心及方便，突吉羅；若發行，步步波逸提。</lzh>
If she thinks about and plans it, it’s a dukkaṭa. If she sets out, each step is a pācittiya.

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼，突吉羅。</lzh>
For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>不為看戲往，皆不犯。</lzh>
If she doesn’t go to watch the entertainment, in all cases the offense isn’t committed.
