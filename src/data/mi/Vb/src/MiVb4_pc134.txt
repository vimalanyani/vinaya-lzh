<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼共諍，各作呪誓言：「我若如是，當墮地獄。如調達、瞿伽梨受罪，我亦當爾！我若不如是，汝當受如是罪！」諸長老比丘尼聞，種種訶責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs quarreled with each other, and each spoke a curse: “If I’m like this, may I fall into hell. Like Devadatta and Kokālika received punishment, it’ll also be the same for me. If I’m not like this, you’ll receive such a punishment.” When the senior bhikkhunīs heard it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，自呪誓，實以呪彼，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī curses herself in order to actually curse others, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>作此呪誓，語語波逸提。</lzh>
When she speaks the curse, each word is a pācittiya.
