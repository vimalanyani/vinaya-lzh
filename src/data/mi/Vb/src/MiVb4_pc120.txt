<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼新受戒，不依承和尚，無人教誡故，愚無所知不能學戒。諸長老比丘尼見，種種呵責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs who were newly ordained didn’t support their preceptors. Because nobody instructed them, they were ignorant and without knowledge, and unable to train in the precepts. When the senior bhikkhunīs saw it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，新受具足戒，不六年依承和尚，若使人依承者，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a newly ordained bhikkhunī doesn’t support her preceptor for six years, or has others support her, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼，突吉羅。</lzh>
For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>若和尚不須依承者，不犯。</lzh>
If the preceptor doesn’t need support, the offense isn’t committed.
