<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸長者請差摩比丘尼於舍衛城安居，作是言：「若受我請，當隨時供給！」便受其請。遂長住，不復餘行。彼諸長者譏訶言：「我等應作餘事，諸比丘尼不知籌量，不復知去！此等常說少欲知足，而今無厭！」諸長老比丘尼聞，種種訶責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, householders invited Khemā bhikkhunī to enter the rains retreat at Sāvatthī and said: “If you accept our invitation, we’ll support you at the right time.” Then she accepted their invitation. Thereupon, she stayed for long, and didn’t wander elsewhere anymore. These householders were upset and said: “We should be doing other things. This bhikkhunī doesn’t know how to consider properly, and doesn’t understand she should leave. They always say that they’ve few wishes and know moderation, but now she has no limit.” When the senior bhikkhunīs heard it, they criticized her in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，就安居請竟，一宿不去，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī, when an invitation for the rains retreat is over, doesn’t leave for one night, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼，突吉羅。</lzh>
For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>若病，若恐怖，若不齊限請，若非受請處安居，不去，不犯。</lzh>
If she’s sick, if she’s afraid, if there’s an unlimited invitation, or if she hasn’t received an invitation to enter the rains retreat there, and doesn’t leave, the offense isn’t committed.
