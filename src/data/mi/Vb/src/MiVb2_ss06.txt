<h2>First Origin Stories</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼獨行道路，諸白衣見，調弄作麁惡婬欲語，或捉捫摸，或欲共為不淨行。</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs wandered on a road alone. When the lay people saw them, they fooled around, spoke coarse, unwholesome words about sexual desire, some touched and groped them, and some wanted to engage in sexual intercourse.

<lzh>復有眾多比丘尼與估客伴行，偷羅難陀見一男子心生染著，漸遲在後。諸比丘尼語言：「汝何不速行及伴？此處可畏，勿為惡人之所剝脫！」答言：「汝見後來人不？」諸比丘尼言：「見！」偷羅難陀言：「我見此人，心甚樂著！」諸比丘尼呵責言：「汝云何於行路中，染著男子？」</lzh>
There was also a group of bhikkhunīs who were wandering in company with merchants. Thullanandā saw a man and defiled attachment arose in her mind. She lagged behind and the bhikkhunīs asked her: “Why don’t you walk at the same speed as the group? This place is frightening, don’t be robbed by evil people.” She answered: “Do you see the person coming behind us?” The bhikkhunīs said: “We see him.” Thullanandā said: “When I saw this man, my mind was strongly attracted.” The bhikkhunīs criticized her: “When you wander on a road, why do you have defiled attachment to a man?”

<lzh>復有眾多比丘尼渡河取牛屎，既渡，水漲不得還，為賊抄掠。</lzh>
There was also a group of bhikkhunīs who crossed a river and collected cow dung. When they had crossed, the water rose. They weren’t able to return and were robbed by criminals.

<lzh>復有諸比丘尼獨宿，失衣鉢、破梵行。諸長老比丘尼見聞，種種呵責，具以白佛。佛以是事集二部僧，問諸比丘尼：「汝等實爾不？」答言：「實爾。世尊！」佛種種呵責已，告諸比丘：「今為諸比丘尼結戒，從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
There were also bhikkhunīs who stayed overnight alone. They lost their robes and bowls, and broke celibacy. When the senior bhikkhunīs saw and heard it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, and fully told the Buddha of this. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter and asked the bhikkhunīs: “Did you really do this?” They answered: “We really did it, World-honored One.” When the Buddha had criticized them in all kinds of ways, he told the bhikkhus: “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Preliminary Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，獨行，獨宿，獨渡水，於道中獨在後染著男子，是比丘尼初犯僧伽婆尸沙，可悔過。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī wanders alone, stays overnight alone, crosses water alone, lags behind on a path alone with defiled attachment for a man, that bhikkhunī commits an immediate saṅghādisesa, from which one can repent.’”


<h2>Second Origin Stories</h2>

<lzh>時有諸比丘尼在路行，有疑恐怖，便走向聚落至親里家。復有諸比丘尼行路疲極，又有老病，不能相及；或有小水、或有橋船，不敢獨渡；或有宿處，畏諸男子，不敢獨於餘處宿。諸比丘尼不知云何？以事白佛。佛以是事集二部僧，告諸比丘：「有因緣聽隨意獨去。從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
Then there were bhikkhunīs who were wandering on a road that was dubious and frightening. Then they quickly went to a village and reached their relatives’ house. There were also bhikkhunīs who were wandering on a road and became very exhausted, or were old and sick, and couldn’t keep up with the others. 
Sometimes, there was just little water, and sometimes there was a bridge or a boat, and they didn’t dare to cross alone.
Sometimes in the place where they were staying overnight, there were frightening men, and they didn’t dare to stay alone overnight in another place. 
The bhikkhunīs didn’t know what to do. They told the Buddha of this matter. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter and told the bhikkhus: “If there’s a reason, I allow them to go alone as they like. From now on, this precept should be recited thus:


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，獨行，獨宿，獨渡水，於道中獨在後染著男子，除因緣，是比丘尼初犯僧伽婆尸沙，可悔過。因緣者：恐怖走時，老病疲極不及伴時，水狹淺、有橋船處，畏男子處，是名因緣。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī wanders alone, stays overnight alone, crosses water alone, lags behind on a path alone with defiled attachment for a man, unless there’s a reason, that bhikkhunī commits an immediate saṅghādisesa, from which one can repent. “A reason” means when one goes in fear, when one is old, sick, or very exhausted, and can’t keep up with the companions, when the water is narrow and shallow, at a place with a bridge or a boat, at a place with frightening men; these are called “a reason”.’”<note>The pātimokkha only has three factors of this rule, and doesn’t include wandering alone.</note>


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>若獨行無聚落處，半由旬；若有聚落處，從一聚落至一聚落，皆僧伽婆尸沙。</lzh>
If she wanders alone in a place where there’s no village for half a yojana, or in a place where there’s a village from one village to another village, both cases are a saṅghādisesa.

<lzh>若在後，遙見比丘尼，不聞聲；或聞聲，不見形，皆突吉羅。</lzh>
If she’s behind and can see the other bhikkhunī from a distance but can’t hear her, or if she can hear her but can’t see her, both cases are dukkaṭas.

<lzh>若不見、不聞，僧伽婆尸沙。</lzh>
If she can neither see nor hear her, it’s a saṅghādisesa.

<lzh>若獨渡水，水廣十肘，深半髀，僧伽婆尸沙；若減，突吉羅。</lzh>
If she crosses water alone, and the water is wider than the length of 10 forearms and deeper than halfway up to the thigh, it’s a saṅghādisesa. If it’s less, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>若宿時，應使手相及；若不相及，初夜及中夜，偷羅遮；明相出，僧伽婆尸沙。</lzh>
If she stays overnight, she should reach out with her hand to the other. If she doesn’t reach out to the other during the first part and the middle part of the night, it’s a thullaccaya. At dawn, it’s a saṅghādisesa.

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼，突吉羅。</lzh>
For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.
