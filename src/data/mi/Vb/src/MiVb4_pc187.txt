<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時跋難陀常出入偷羅難陀比丘尼所；後時著衣持鉢往到彼所，坐起輕脫，更相見形。跋難陀遂失不淨，偷羅難陀取內衣浣，以不淨自內形中，遂致有娠。諸比丘尼見，問言：「汝不修梵行耶？」答言：「非不修梵行！我以男子不淨，自內形中，致此娠耳！」諸長老比丘尼聞，種種呵責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, Upananda often went in and out of Thullanandā bhikkhunī’s place. At a later time, he put on his robes, took his bowl, and went to her. They sat down and got up frivolously, and looked at each other’s bodies. Upananda thereupon emitted semen. Thullanandā took his lower robe to wash it, and inserted the semen into her body. Thereupon, she became pregnant. When the bhikkhunīs saw it, they asked: “Aren’t you practising celibacy?” She answered: “It’s not that I’m not practising celibacy. I inserted a man’s semen into my body, and became pregnant from that.” When the senior bhikkhunīs heard it, they criticized her in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，以男子不淨自內形中，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī inserts a man’s semen into her body, it’s a pācittiya.’”
