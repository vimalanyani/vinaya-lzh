<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼離五衣，著麁弊衣至諸家。諸長老比丘尼見，種種訶責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs went to the houses without their five robes, wearing coarse, worn out robes. When the senior bhikkhunīs saw it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，離五衣行，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī walks around without her five robes, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>離五衣者：從一家至一家，乃至出所住門，波逸提。</lzh>
“Without her five robes” means if she goes from one house to another, or even just leaves through the door of her residence, it’s a pācittiya.

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼，突吉羅。</lzh>
For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>若浣染打縫時，不犯。</lzh>
When she washes, dyes, beats, or sews them, the offense isn’t committed.
