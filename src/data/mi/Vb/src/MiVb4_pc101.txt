<h2>First Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時差摩比丘尼命過，諸比丘尼於比丘僧坊中為起骨塔，其眷屬日三反圍繞，啼哭言：「施我法者！施我衣、食、床、臥具、醫藥者！如何一旦捨我長逝？」諸比丘厭患，妨廢坐禪行道。</lzh>
At that time, Khemā bhikkhunī passed away. The bhikkhunīs built a relic stupa inside a bhikkhu monastery. Her disciples circumambulated it three times daily, cried, and said: “She’s the one who has offered us the dhamma. She’s the one who has offered us robes, food, beds, bedding, and medicines. How could she just leave us and pass away?” The bhikkhus became wearied, and were prevented from sitting meditation and practising the path.
<lzh>時優波離來入僧坊，問舊住比丘：「此是何聲？」具以事答，優波離即使人壞之。諸比丘尼聞，共作是議：「我等皆當持杖打彼比丘，若不同往，不復共住！」議已，皆執杖詣僧坊，見比丘便圍繞欲打，知非乃止；進前於狹路逢優波離，前後共遮，舉杖欲打。優波離即以神力飛到佛所，以事白佛。佛以是事集二部僧，問諸比丘尼：「汝等實爾不？」答言：「實爾。世尊！」佛種種訶責比丘尼言：「汝等所作非法！云何比丘尼打比丘！」訶責已，告諸比丘：「今為諸比丘尼結戒，從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
Then Upāli came to the monastery and asked the bhikkhus who had lived there for a long time: “What is this sound?” They explained this matter in full. Upāli then had people destroy it. When the bhikkhunīs heard it, they said to each other: “We’ll all take sticks and beat this bhikkhu. If someone doesn’t go with us, we’ll not live together with her anymore.” Having said this, they all took sticks and went to the monastery. When they saw the bhikkhu, they surrounded him and wanted to beat him, and stop when he realized his mistake. They advanced towards Upāli on a narrow path, blocked him in front and from behind, raised their sticks and wanted to beat him. Upāli then flew with psychic powers to the Buddha and told him of this matter. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter and asked the bhikkhunīs: “Did you really do this?” They answered: “We really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized the bhikkhunīs in all kinds of ways: “What you did is against the dhamma. Why does a bhikkhunī beat a bhikkhu!” Having criticized them, he told the bhikkhus: “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus:


<h2>First Preliminary Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，入比丘住處，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī enters a bhikkhu residence, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Second Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>有諸比丘尼行路見空僧坊，欲入禮拜，而不敢入；以事白佛。佛以是事集二部僧，告諸比丘：「今聽比丘尼入空僧坊！從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
There were bhikkhunīs who were wandering on a road and saw an empty monastery. They wanted to enter and pay respect, but they didn’t dare to enter. They told the Buddha of this matter. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter and told the bhikkhus: “I now allow the bhikkhunīs to enter an empty monastery. From now on, this precept should be recited thus:


<h2>Second Preliminary Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，入有比丘住處，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī enters a residence where there’s a bhikkhu, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Third Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>有諸比丘尼於僧坊內有因緣事，須入而不敢入。以事白佛。佛以是事集二部僧，告諸比丘：「今聽比丘尼有緣事須入僧坊，白比丘，比丘聽，然後入！從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
There were bhikkhunīs who had some business to do in a monastery. They needed to enter, but they didn’t dare to. They told the Buddha of this matter. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter and told the bhikkhus: “I now allow bhikkhunīs, who have some business to do and need to enter a monastery, to tell a bhikkhu and to enter after the bhikkhu has allowed it. From now on, this precept should be recited thus:


<h2>Third Preliminary Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，入有比丘住處，不白比丘，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī enters a residence where there’s a bhikkhu without telling him, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Fourth Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>有諸比丘尼有緣事欲入僧坊，諸比丘或坐禪、或眠，不能得白。以事白佛。佛以是事集二部僧，告諸比丘：「今聽諸比丘尼進入坊內，見比丘便白。從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
There were bhikkhunīs who had some business to do and wanted to enter a monastery. The bhikkhus sat in meditation or slept, and they were unable to tell them. They told the Buddha of this matter. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter and told the bhikkhus: “I now allow the bhikkhunīs to advance and enter a monastery and to tell a bhikkhu when they see one. From now on, this precept should be recited thus:


<h2>Fourth Preliminary Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，入有比丘住處，見比丘不白，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī enters a residence where there’s a bhikkhu, and when she sees him doesn’t tell him, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Fifth Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>有諸比丘尼急難時，欲避難入僧坊，而不敢入，或為賊所奪，或為惡獸所害。以事白佛。佛以是事集二部僧，告諸比丘：「今聽比丘尼若急難時，隨意入僧坊。從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
There were bhikkhunīs in immediate difficulties. They wanted to enter a monastery to avoid the difficulties, but they didn’t dare to. Some were abducted by criminals, and some were harmed by savage animals. They told the Buddha of this matter. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter and told the bhikkhus: “I now allow the bhikkhunīs to enter a monastery as they like when there’s an immediate difficulty. From now on, this precept should be recited thus:


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，入有比丘住處，見比丘不白，除急難時，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī enters a residence where there’s a bhikkhu, and when she sees him doesn’t tell him, unless there’s an immediate difficulty, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>若不見比丘，不得白而入，須見比丘便往白。彼比丘應籌量，若可入時，應聽入；若不可入時，不應聽入。</lzh>
If she doesn’t see a bhikkhu and isn’t able to tell him, but enters, she needs to go and tell a bhikkhu when she sees one. The bhikkhu should evaluate it. If it’s a time when she can enter, he should allow her to enter. If it’s a time when she can’t enter, he shouldn’t allow her to enter.

<lzh>見而不白及不聽而入，波逸提。</lzh>
If she sees him but doesn’t tell him, and if he doesn’t allow it but she enters, it’s a pācittiya.

For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.
