<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼同學病，不看視故，或不時差，或至命過。諸長老比丘尼見，種種呵責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, the bhikkhunīs’ fellow nuns were sick, and because they didn’t look after them, some didn’t recover in time, and others passed away. When the senior bhikkhunīs saw it, they criticized them in all kinds of ways, … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，同學病，不自看、不教人看，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī’s fellow nun is sick, and she doesn’t look after her herself, or instructs others to look after her, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>同學者：同和尚、阿闍梨，及常共伴。</lzh>
“A fellow nun” means someone with the same preceptor, with the same teacher, or a frequent companion.

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼，突吉羅。</lzh>
For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>若住止不同，不犯。</lzh>
If they don’t stay in the same place, the offense isn’t committed.
