<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時差摩比丘尼欲來舍衛城，旃茶修摩那比丘尼聞其欲來，便到其主人家，語言：「差摩比丘尼當來，可為少多設供！」答言：「我亦聞其當來，乃欲自竭辦美飲食，及以衣施。」彼比丘尼便言：「何不以衣施僧？僧中有正趣、正行人，無所不攝。何用施一比丘尼為？」主人聞已，即轉施僧。差摩比丘尼到，為設多美飲食，手自斟酌，食竟竊語：「今正是施衣時，而旃荼修摩那比丘尼，斷我此事！」諸比丘尼問：「汝等何所說？」具以事答。長老比丘尼種種訶責：「云何斷施人物，與僧？」種種訶責，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, Khemā bhikkhunī wanted to come to Sāvatthī. Chandasumanā bhikkhunī heard that she wanted to come, went to her supporters’ house, and said: “Khemā bhikkhunī will come, please set up some offerings for her.” They answered: “We also heard that she’ll come, and we wanted to fully prepare good drinks and food ourselves, and also offer her robes.” The bhikkhunī then said: “Why don’t you offer robes to the sangha? In the sangha, there are people who are going in the right direction and are practising well, and there’s nothing (wholesome) they don’t include. What’s the use of offering to one bhikkhunī?” When the supporters heard this, they directed their offering to the sangha. When Khemā bhikkhunī arrived, they set up many good drinks and food, and served her with their own hands. After the meal, they privately said: “Now is really a time for offering robes, but Chandasumanā bhikkhunī has prevented us from this activity.” The bhikkhunīs asked: “What were you saying?” They explained this matter in full. The senior bhikkhunīs criticized her in all kinds of ways: “Why did you prevent an offering of an item to an individual, and gave it to the sangha?” Having criticized her in all kinds of ways … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，斷施人物，與僧，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī prevents an offering of an item to an individual, and gives it to the sangha, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>施人者：於僧中別有所與，名為施人。</lzh>
“An offering to an individual” means that which is given to someone separate from the sangha. This is called “an offering to an individual”.

For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.
