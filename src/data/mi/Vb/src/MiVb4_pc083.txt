<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時旃荼修摩那比丘尼弟子獨得五新衣，白和尚言：「為我先著，使我獲福！」和尚既著，便不復還，弟子著麁弊衣行。諸比丘尼見，問言：「汝獨得五新衣，何故不著？」答言：「我先用供養和尚，和尚不復見還！」諸比丘尼訶責旃茶修摩那：「云何弟子得新衣，先以供養，便不復還？」諸長老比丘尼以事白佛，乃至今為諸比丘尼結戒，亦如上說。「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
At that time, Chandasumanā bhikkhunī’s student obtained five new robes for herself. She told her preceptor: “Wear it for me first, and let me make merit.” Then the preceptor wore it, and didn’t give it back again. The student walked around wearing coarse, worn out robes. When the other bhikkhunīs saw it, they asked: “You obtained five new robes for yourself. Why don’t you wear them?” She answered: “I used them to offer to my preceptor first, and my precepter didn’t see to returning them.” The bhikkhunīs criticized Chandasumanā: “Why did you, when your student obtained new robes and offered them to you first, not return them?” The senior bhikkhunīs told the Buddha of this matter. … “I now lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, as explained above. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，得新衣先以供養，便不復還，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī obtains a new robe as a first-use offering, and then doesn’t return it, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>若比丘尼得新衣，供養彼比丘尼，彼比丘尼應一日著；若令更著，復應為著，隨主意久近。若過限，波逸提。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī obtains a new robe and offers it to another bhikkhunī, that bhikkhunī should wear it for one day. If she still has her wear it for longer, she should again wear it, according to the duration the owner intended. If she exceeds that limit, it’s a pācittiya.

For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.
