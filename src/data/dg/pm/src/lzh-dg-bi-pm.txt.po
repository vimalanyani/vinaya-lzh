<verse>I now wish to recite well, may the virtuous ones all listen together.</verse>
<lzh-verse>譬如人毀足，不堪有所涉，</lzh-verse>
<verse>Just as someone with an injured foot, can’t endure traveling,</verse>
<lzh-verse>毀戒亦如是，不得生天人。</lzh-verse>

<lzh>nidāna</lzh>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<lzh>「大姊僧聽！今十五日，眾僧說戒。若僧時到，僧忍聽，和合說戒。白如是。」</lzh>
“Venerable sisters, may the sangha listen! Today is the fifteenth day and the sangha recites the precepts. If the right time has come for the sangha, may the sangha approve that we recite the precepts in harmony. This is the motion.”

<lzh>(「作白成不？」答云：「成。」)</lzh>
“Has the motion been completed?” Answer: “It’s been completed.”

<lzh>「諸大姊！我今欲說波羅提木叉戒。汝等諦聽，善思念之。若自知有犯者，即應自懺悔；不犯者，默然。默然者，知諸大姊清淨。若有他問者，亦如是答。如是比丘尼在眾中，乃至三問，憶念有罪，不懺悔者，得故妄語罪。故妄語者，佛說障道法。若彼比丘尼，憶念有罪，欲求清淨者，應懺悔。懺悔得安樂。諸大姊！我已說戒經序。</lzh>
“Venerable sisters! I now wish to recite the pātimokkha precepts. You should listen attentively and consider them well. If you yourself know that you have broken them, then you should confess it; if you haven’t broken them, you should remain silent. By your silence I’ll know that the venerable sisters are pure. If you’re asked by others, you should answer accordingly. If a bhikkhunī in this way in the midst of the assembly when asked up to three times, remembers that she has an offense, but doesn’t confess it, she incurs an offense of intentional lying. Intentional lying has been declared an obstacle to the dhamma path by the Buddha. If that bhikkhunī who remembers that she has an offense desires purification, she should confess it. Confession leads to peace and happiness. Venerable sisters, I’ve recited the introduction to the precepts sutta.

<lzh>「今問諸大姊：是中清淨不？(如是至三)。</lzh>
Now I ask the venerable sisters: ‘Are you pure herein?’ (Repeat three times.)

<lzh>「諸大姊！是中清淨，默然故。是事如是持。</lzh>
The venerable sisters are pure herein, therefore you’re silent. This matter is remembered thus.

<lzh>8 pārājika rules</lzh>
<h2>8 Pārājika Rules</h2>

<lzh>「諸大姊！是八波羅夷法，半月半月說，戒經中來。</lzh>
Venerable sisters, the eight pārājika rules that are recited every half month in the precepts sutta are coming up.

<lzh>pārājika 1</lzh>
<h3>Pārājika 1</h3>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，作婬欲，犯不淨行，乃至共畜生。是比丘尼波羅夷，不共住。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī engages in sexual intercourse, and commits impure practices, even with an animal, that bhikkhuni is pārājika, and doesn’t live in community.

<lzh>pārājika 2</lzh>
<h3>Pārājika 2</h3>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，在聚落、若空閑處，不與，懷盜心取；隨所盜物，若為王、若王大臣所捉，若縛、若殺、若驅出國：『汝賊！汝癡！汝無所知。』若比丘尼作如是不與取，是比丘尼波羅夷，不共住。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī in the village or the wilderness takes what isn’t given with the intention to steal it; and the stolen item is such that the king or the king’s high officials would arrest, bind, kill or banish her from the country, (saying): ‘You criminal, you fool, you ignorant person!,’ if that bhikkhunī in this way takes what isn’t given, she’s pārājika, and doesn’t live in community.

<lzh>pārājika 3</lzh>
<h3>Pārājika 3</h3>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，故自手斷人命，若持刀授與人，若歎死、譽死、勸死：『咄！人用此惡活為？寧死不生。』作如是心念，無數方便，歎死、譽死、勸死。此比丘尼波羅夷，不共住。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī intentionally and with her own hand takes the life of a human being, or takes a knife and gives it to someone, or encourages, praises and recommends death, (saying): ‘Hey, what use is this bad life? Death is preferable, don’t live on’; if thinking like this, she with countless skillful means encourages, praises and recommends death, that bhikkhunī is pārājika, and doesn’t live in community.

<lzh>pārājika 4</lzh>
<h3>Pārājika 4</h3>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，實無所知，自歎譽言：『我得過人法，入聖智勝法，我知是，我見是。』後於異時，若問、若不問，欲求清淨故，作如是言：『諸大姊！我實不知、不見，而言我知、我見，虛、誑、妄語。』除增上慢。是比丘尼波羅夷，不共住。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī, who doesn’t really know, to praise herself, says: ‘I’ve attained a superhuman state, I’ve entered the superior state of noble knowledge, I know this, I see this,’ and at a later time, whether questioned or not questioned, because she desires purification, says: ‘Venerable sisters, I didn’t really know and see, but I said I knew and saw; it was empty, untrue, false speech,’ except in a case of superiority conceit, that bhikkhunī is pārājika, and doesn’t live in community.

<lzh>pārājika 5</lzh>
<h3>Pārājika 5</h3>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，染污心，共染污心男子，從腋已下，膝已上，身相觸。若捉摩、若牽、若推、若上摩、若下摩、若舉、若下、若捉、若捺。是比丘尼波羅夷，不共住。是身相觸也。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī with a defiled mind and a man with a defiled mind have their bodies touch each other below the armpits and above the knees; if they grasp, pull, push, rub upwards and downwards, lift up, set down, hold, and press each other, that bhikkhunī is pārājika, and doesn’t live in community, because she’s ‘one with bodily contact’.

<lzh>pārājika 6</lzh>
<h3>Pārājika 6</h3>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，染污心，知男子染污心，受捉手、捉衣、入屏處、共立、共語、共行、或身相倚、或共期。是比丘尼波羅夷，不共住。犯此八事故。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī with a defiled mind knows that a man has a defiled mind, and lets him hold her hand, and hold her robes, and they enter a secluded place, stand together, talk together, walk together, lean their bodies against each other, and make appointments, that bhikkhunī is pārājika, and doesn’t live in community, because she committed the eight things.

<lzh>pārājika 7</lzh>
<h3>Pārājika 7</h3>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，知比丘尼犯波羅夷，不自發露，不語眾人，不白大眾。若於異時，彼比丘尼或命終、或眾中舉、或休道、或入外道眾，後作是言：『我先知有如是如是罪。』是比丘尼波羅夷，不共住。覆藏重罪故。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī knows that another bhikkhunī has committed a pārājika, and neither discloses it herself, nor tells members of the assembly, nor informs the great assembly, but if at a later time after that bhikkhunī has either passed away, or been charged in the midst of the assembly, or disrobed, or joined a non-Buddhist group, she should say: ‘I previously already knew that she had such-and-such an offense,’ that bhikkhunī is pārājika, and doesn’t live in community, because she concealed a heavy offense.

<lzh>pārājika 8</lzh>
<h3>Pārājika 8</h3>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，知比丘，僧為作舉，如法如律，如佛所教，不順從，不懺悔，僧未與作共住；而順從。諸比丘尼語言：『大姊！此比丘為僧所舉，如法如律，如佛所教，不順從，不懺悔，僧未與作共住；汝莫順從。』如是比丘尼諫彼比丘尼時，堅持不捨。彼比丘尼應第二、第三諫，令捨此事故。乃至三諫，捨者善。若不捨者，是比丘尼波羅夷，不共住。犯隨舉故。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī knows that a bhikkhu has been suspended by the sangha according to dhamma and vinaya, according to the Buddha’s teaching, but that he doesn’t comply, doesn’t repent, and that the sangha hasn’t yet allowed him back to live with the community again, and she still follows him, the bhikkhunīs should say: ‘Venerable sister, this bhikkhu has been suspended by the sangha according to dhamma and vinaya, according to the Buddha’s teaching, but he doesn’t comply, doesn’t repent, and the sangha hasn’t yet allowed him back to live with the community again; don’t follow him.’ If when the bhikkhunīs admonish that bhikkhunī like this, she holds firmly on to this matter and doesn’t give it up, she should be admonished a second and third time to make her give up this matter. If she gives it up by the third admonishment, it’s fine. If not, that bhikkhunī is pārājika, and doesn’t live in community, because she committed the act of following a suspended one.

<lzh>「諸大姊！我已說八波羅夷法。若比丘尼，犯一一波羅夷法，不得與諸比丘尼共住如前，後亦如是，是比丘尼得波羅夷罪，不應共住。</lzh>
Venerable sisters, I’ve recited the eight pārājika rules. If a bhikkhunī has broken any of these pārājika rules, she may not live in community with the bhikkhunīs. As before, so also afterwards.<note>i.e. she reverts to a lay person, as before.</note> She incurs a pārājika offense, and should not live in community.

<lzh>「今問諸大姊：是中清淨不？(如是至三)</lzh>
Now I ask the venerable sisters: ‘Are you pure herein?’ (Repeat three times)

<lzh>「諸大姊！是中清淨，默然故。是事如是持。</lzh>
The venerable sisters are pure herein, therefore you’re silent. This matter is remembered thus.

<lzh>17 saṅghādisesa rules</lzh>
<h2>17 Saṅghādisesa Rules</h2>

If a bhikkhunī, angry and dissatisfied, takes an aspect of a different matter and slanders a bhikkhunī who hasn’t commited a pārājika with an unfounded pārājika, wishing to destroy her monastic life, and at a later time, whether questioned or not questioned, it becomes known that she has taken an aspect of a different matter and that she said this because she was in a state of anger, that bhikkhunī commits an immediate offense that should be given up, a saṅghādisesa.

If a bhikkhunī previously knows that a woman is a criminal, sentenced to death, whom people know about, and she, without asking the king, a high official, or (the woman’s) clan, gives her the going forth and the higher ordination, that bhikkhunī commits an immediate offense that should be given up, a saṅghādisesa.

<lzh>「若比丘尼，知比丘尼為僧所舉，如法如律，如佛所教，不順從，未懺悔，僧未與作共住羯磨；為愛故，不問僧，僧不約勅，出界外，作羯磨，與解罪。是比丘尼犯初法應捨，僧伽婆尸沙。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī knows that another bhikkhunī has been suspended by the sangha according to dhamma and vinaya, according to the Buddha’s teaching, but doesn’t comply, hasn’t repented, and the sangha hasn’t yet carried out the formal act of living with the community, but out of affection, without asking the sangha, without the sangha’s approval, she goes outside the territory and carries out the formal act to release her from the offense, that bhikkhunī commits an immediate offense that should be given up, a saṅghādisesa.

If a bhikkhunī teaches another bhikkhunī by saying: ‘Venerable sister, whether he has a defiled mind or an undefiled mind, what does it matter to you? You yourself have an undefiled mind. If you receive food from him, accept it at the right time in purity,’ that bhikkhunī commits an immediate offense that should be given up, a saṅghādisesa.

If a bhikkhunī wants to destroy the sangha in harmony, makes plans for a matter that can split the sangha, and holds firmly on to it without giving it up, the bhikkhunīs should admonish that bhikkhunī, saying: ‘Venerable sister, don’t destroy the sangha in harmony, don’t make plans to destroy the sangha in harmony, don’t accept a matter that can split the sangha, holding firmly on to it without giving it up. Venerable sister, you should be in harmony with the sangha. When you’re in harmony with the sangha, happy, and without quarreling, training under one teacher, mixing like water and milk, you’ll grow in the Buddha’s dhamma and live comfortably.’ If when the bhikkhunīs admonish that bhikkhunī, she holds firmly on to it and doesn’t give it up, the bhikkhunīs should admonish her three times to give up this matter. If she gives it up by the third time, it’s fine. If not, that bhikkhunī commits an offense that should be given up after three admonishments, a saṅghādisesa. (Ten)

<lzh>saṅghādisesa 11</lzh>
<h3>Saṅghādisesa 11</h3>

If the bhikkhunī has a faction of other bhikkhunīs, one, two, three, or up to innumerably many, and if they say to the bhikkhunīs: ‘Venerable sisters, don’t admonish this bhikkhunī. This bhikkhunī is a bhikkhunī who speaks the dhamma and the vinaya. Our minds delight in what this bhikkhunī says, and we approve of it,’ the bhikkhunīs should tell them: ‘Venerable sisters, don’t say this: “This bhikkhunī is a bhikkhunī who speaks the dhamma and the vinaya. Our minds delight in what this bhikkhunī says, and we approve of it.” Why? What this bhikkhunī says is not the dhamma and the vinaya. Venerable sisters, don’t wish to split and destroy the sangha in harmony, you should delight in a sangha in harmony. Venerable sisters, when you’re in harmony with the sangha, happy, and without quarreling, training under one teacher, mixing like water and milk, you’ll grow in the Buddha’s dhamma and live comfortably.’ If when the bhikkhunīs admonish those bhikkhunīs, they hold firmly on to it and don’t give it up, the bhikkhunīs should admonish them three times to give up this matter. If they give it up by the third time, it’s fine. If not, those bhikkhunīs commit an offense that should be given up after three admonishments, a saṅghādisesa.

<lzh>saṅghādisesa 12</lzh>
<h3>Saṅghādisesa 12</h3>

<lzh>「若比丘尼，依城邑、若村落住，污他家，行惡行。行惡行，亦見亦聞；污他家，亦見亦聞。是比丘尼諫彼比丘尼言：『大姊！汝污他家，行惡行。行惡行，亦見亦聞；污他家，亦見亦聞。大姊！汝污他家，行惡行，今可離此村落去，不須住此。』彼比丘尼語此比丘尼作是言：『大姊！諸比丘尼有愛、有恚、有怖、有癡，有如是同罪比丘尼，有驅者，有不驅者。』是諸比丘尼語彼比丘尼言：『大姊！莫作是語：「有愛、有恚、有怖、有癡。」亦莫言：「有如是同罪比丘尼，有驅者，有不驅者。」何以故？而諸比丘尼不愛、不恚、不怖、不癡，有如是同罪比丘尼，有驅者，有不驅者。大姊！污他家，行惡行。行惡行，亦見亦聞；污他家，亦見亦聞。』是比丘尼諫彼比丘尼時，堅持不捨。是比丘尼應三諫，捨此事故。乃至三諫，捨者善。不捨者，是比丘尼犯三法應捨，僧伽婆尸沙。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī lives supported by a city or village and corrupts families, engages in unwholesome conduct, and her unwholesome conduct is both seen and heard, and her corruption of families is both seen and heard, the bhikkhunīs should admonish her, saying: ‘Venerable sister, you corrupt families and engage in unwholesome conduct, and your unwholesome conduct is both seen and heard, and your corruption of families is both seen and heard; venerable sister, you corrupt families and engage in unwholesome conduct, please leave this village now, you mustn’t live here.’ If that bhikkhunī then says to the bhikkhunīs: ‘Venerable sisters, the bhikkhunīs have desire, anger, fear, and delusion. There are bhikkhunīs with the same offense, and some are expelled and some aren’t,’ then the bhikkhunīs should answer: ‘Venerable sister, don’t say: “They have desire, anger, fear, and delusion.” Also don’t say: “There are bhikkhunīs with the same offense, and some are expelled and some aren’t.” Why? Because the bhikkhunīs don’t have desire, anger, fear and delusion. (There are no) bhikkhunīs with the same offense, and (it’s not the case that) some are expelled and some aren’t. Venerable sister, you corrupt families and engage in unwholesome conduct, and your unwholesome conduct is both seen and heard, and your corruption of families is both seen and heard.’ If when the bhikkhunīs admonish that bhikkhunī, she holds firmly on to it and doesn’t give it up, the bhikkhunīs should admonish her three times to give up this matter. If she gives it up by the third time, it’s fine. If not, that bhikkhunī commits an offense that should be given up after three admonishments, a saṅghādisesa.

I also won’t tell you about good and bad. May the venerable sisters stop! Don’t admonish me,’ the bhikkhunīs should admonish her thus: ‘Venerable sister, don’t refuse to accept admonishment. Venerable sister, you should accept admonishment. The venerable sister should admonish the bhikkhunīs according to dhamma, and the bhikkhunīs should also admonish the venerable sister according to dhamma.

If you don’t live closely together, you’ll grow in the Buddha’s dhamma, and live comfortably.’ If when the bhikkhunīs admonish those bhikkhunīs like this, they hold firmly on to it and don’t give it up, the bhikkhunīs should admonish them three times to give up this matter.

If I need a robe, I’ll accept something pure at the right time.’ If the messenger says to the bhikkhunī: ‘Venerable, do you have a manager?’, the bhikkhunī who needs a robe should say: ‘I do. Either a monastery attendant or a lay person, these are the bhikkhunīs’ managers, who often manage things for the bhikkhunīs.’ After having gone to the manager and given them the robe fund, the messenger returns to the bhikkhunī and says: ‘Venerable, I’ve given the robe fund to the manager So-and-so you indicated. Venerable, when you know that the right time has come, you should go to them and receive a robe.’ If that bhikkhunī needs a robe, she should go to that manager and say two or three times: ‘I need a robe.’ If at the second or third time of reminding them, she obtains a robe, it’s fine. If she doesn’t obtain a robe, she may stand silently in front of them for a fourth, fifth, and sixth time to make them remember. If at the fourth, fifth, and sixth time of silently standing in front of them, she obtains the robe, it’s fine. If she doesn’t obtain the robe, and continues to seek to obtain it, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. If she doesn’t obtain the robe, she should either go herself to the place where the messenger came from, or send a messenger there to say: ‘You previously sent a messenger holding a robe fund for bhikkhunī So-and-so.

<lzh>「此是釋迦牟尼如來．無所著．等正覺，於十二年中，為無事僧說是戒經。從是已後，廣分別說。諸比丘尼，自為樂法、樂沙門者，有慚、有愧，樂學戒者，當於中學。</lzh>
Sakyamuni Tathāgata, without attachments and fully enlightened, recited this as his precepts sutta for 12 years to the sangha without offenses. Afterwards, he spoke broadly and in detail. Bhikkhunīs, for your own happiness in the dhamma, for the happiness of renunciates, out of conscience and shame, for the happiness of those training in the precepts, you should train in them.

<lzh-verse>「明人能護戒，能得三種樂，</lzh-verse>
<verse>Bright people can protect the precepts, and can attain the three kinds of happiness:</verse>
<lzh-verse>名譽及利養，死得生天上。</lzh-verse>

<lzh-verse>當觀如是處，有智勤護戒，</lzh-verse>
<verse>If one contemplates in this way, the wise strive to protect the precepts,</verse>
<lzh-verse>戒淨有智慧，便得第一道。</lzh-verse>
<verse>With purity of the precepts and wisdom, the supreme path is attained.</verse>
<lzh-verse>如過去諸佛，及以未來者，</lzh-verse>
<verse>As the Buddhas of the past, and those of the future,</verse>
<lzh-verse>現在諸世尊，能勝一切憂，</lzh-verse>
<verse>And the World-honoured Ones of the present, could overcome all sorrows,</verse>
<lzh-verse>皆共尊敬戒，此是諸佛法。</lzh-verse>

<lzh-verse>當尊重正法，此是諸佛教。</lzh-verse>

<verse>The seven Buddhas honored by the world, who cut off all defilements,</verse>
<lzh-verse>說是七戒經，諸縛得解脫。</lzh-verse>
<verse>Spoke these seven precepts suttas, for the liberation from all bonds.</verse>
<lzh-verse>已入於涅槃，諸戲永滅盡，</lzh-verse>
<verse>They’ve entered nibbāna, all proliferations have forever ceased.</verse>
<lzh-verse>尊行大仙說，聖賢稱譽戒，</lzh-verse>
<verse>The great sages honoring the practice said, that the noble ones praise the precepts.</verse>
<lzh-verse>弟子之所行，入寂滅涅槃。</lzh-verse>
<verse>The disciples practised accordingly, and entered extinguishment, nibbāna.</verse>
<lzh-verse>世尊涅槃時，興起於大悲，</lzh-verse>
<verse>When the World-honoured Ones attained nibbāna, they gave rise to great compassion.</verse>
<lzh-verse>集諸比丘眾，與如是教誡：</lzh-verse>
<verse>Gathering the bhikkhu sangha, they taught as follows:</verse>
<lzh-verse>『莫謂我涅槃，淨行者無護。</lzh-verse>
<verse>Do not say after my nibbāna, that the ones practising in purity are without refuge.</verse>
<lzh-verse>我今說戒經，亦善說毘尼，</lzh-verse>
<verse>I’ll now speak the precepts sutta, and will well-recite the vinaya.</verse>
<lzh-verse>我雖般涅槃，當視如世尊。</lzh-verse>
<verse>Even if I enter Parinibbāna, these should be regarded as the World-honoured One.</verse>
<lzh-verse>此經久住世，佛法得熾盛，</lzh-verse>
<verse>This sutta has stayed in the world for a long time, and the Buddha-dhamma has flourished.</verse>
<lzh-verse>以是熾盛故，得入於涅槃。</lzh-verse>
<verse>Because of this flourishing, one can enter into nibbāna.</verse>
<lzh-verse>若不持此戒，如所應布薩，</lzh-verse>
<verse>If the precepts aren’t kept, as they should be for the uposatha,</verse>
<lzh-verse>喻如日沒時，世界皆闇冥。</lzh-verse>
<verse>It’s like at sunset, the whole world would become dark.</verse>
<lzh-verse>當護持是戒，如犛牛愛尾，</lzh-verse>
<verse>One should protect these precepts, as a yak loves its tail.</verse>
<lzh-verse>和合一處坐，如佛之所說。』</lzh-verse>
<verse>Sitting in one place in harmony, as instructed by the Buddha.</verse>
<lzh-verse>我已說戒經，眾僧布薩竟，</lzh-verse>
<verse>I’ve recited the precepts sutta, the sangha’s uposatha is finished.</verse>
<lzh-verse>我今說戒經，所說諸功德，</lzh-verse>
<verse>I’ve now recited the precepts sutta, whose recitation brings many merits.</verse>
<lzh-verse>施一切眾生，皆共成佛道。」</lzh-verse>
<verse>They’re offered to all beings, may they all attain the Buddha’s path.”</verse>
