<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時佛在拘睒彌瞿師羅園中。時世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，告諸比丘：「自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，惡性不受人語，於戒法中諸比丘尼如法諫已，自身不受諫語，言：『大姊！汝莫向我說若好、若惡，我亦不向汝說若好、若惡。諸姊止！莫諫我。』是比丘尼當諫彼比丘尼言：『大姊！汝莫自身不受諫語。大姊！自身當受諫語。大姊！如法諫諸比丘尼，諸比丘尼亦當如法諫大姊！如是佛弟子眾得增益，展轉相諫、展轉相教、展轉懺悔。』是比丘尼如是諫時，堅持不捨，是比丘尼應三諫，捨此事故。乃至三諫捨者善；不捨者，是比丘尼犯三法應捨，僧伽婆尸沙。」(十三竟)</lzh>
At that time, the Buddha was in Kosambī in Ghosita’s park. Then the World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and said to the bhikkhus: “From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī with a bad character doesn’t accept being spoken to, and when the bhikkhunīs admonish her according to dhamma about the precepts and rules, doesn’t accept the admonishment, and says: “Venerable sisters, don’t tell me about good and bad. I also won’t tell you about good and bad. May the sisters stop! Don’t admonish me,” the bhikkhunīs should admonish her thus: “Venerable sister, don’t refuse to accept admonishment. Venerable sister, you should accept admonishment. The venerable sister should admonish the bhikkhunīs according to dhamma, and the bhikkhunīs should also admonish the venerable sister according to dhamma. In this way, the assembly of the Buddha’s disciples achieves growth, by admonishing each other, by teaching each other, and by confessing to each other.” If when the bhikkhunīs admonish that bhikkhunī, she holds firmly on to it and doesn’t give it up, the bhikkhunīs should admonish her three times to give up this matter. If she gives it up by the third time, it’s fine. If not, that bhikkhunī commits an offense that should be given up after three admonishments, a saṅghādisesa.’” (End of the 13th rule.)
