<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>去比丘尼精舍不遠，有好結縷草生。時有諸居士數來在中坐臥調戲，或唄或歌或舞，或有啼哭音聲，亂諸坐禪比丘尼，諸比丘尼患之。居士去後，以大小便糞掃置草上。諸居士還來在中戲時，諸不淨污身及衣服，以此不淨污草，草遂枯死。時諸居士以此事故皆譏嫌言：「此諸比丘尼，受取無厭、不知慚愧，外自稱言：『我知正法。』如是有何正法？我等數來在此戲笑歌舞，云何比丘尼乃以大小便污壞淨草，復污我身及衣服？」</lzh>
Not far from the bhikkhunī monastery, nice string-tying grass was growing. Then householders often came and sat and lay down and entertained themselves, some reciting, some singing, some dancing, and some making wailing sounds. It disturbed the bhikkhunīs sitting in meditation and they suffered from this. After the householders had left, they put excrement, urine, and garbage on the grass. When the householders returned to amuse themselves there, these impure things soiled their bodies and clothes, and they also soiled the grass. The grass slowly withered and died. Because of this matter, the householders were all upset and said: “These bhikkhunīs take without limit, they know no shame. Outwardly, they praise themselves: ‘We know the true dhamma’, how is that the true dhamma? We often came here to amuse ourselves and to sing and dance, why did the bhikkhunīs just soil and destroy the clean grass with excrement and urine, and also soil our bodies and clothes?”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，訶責此諸比丘尼：「云何汝等於居士所遊戲之處，以大小便不淨置生草上，污居士身及衣服，又使生草枯死？」時諸比丘尼往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊爾時以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責此比丘尼：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何比丘尼，居士所遊戲之處，以大小便置生草上，污身及衣服？」世尊以無數方便呵責此比丘尼已，告諸比丘：「此諸比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼在生草上大小便，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They criticized these bhikkhunīs: “Why did you, in a place where householders amuse themselves, put excrement, urine, and impure things on the fresh grass, which soiled the householders’ bodies and clothes, and moreover made the fresh grass wither and die?” Then the bhikkhunīs went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized these bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why, bhikkhunīs, did you, in a place where householders amuse themselves, put excrement and urine on the fresh grass, which soiled the (householders’) bodies and clothes?” Then, when the World-honored One had criticized these bhikkhunīs in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī defecates or urinates on fresh grass, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼於生草上大小便者，波逸提。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī defecates or urinates on fresh grass, it’s a pācittiya.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，或有如是病，若在無草處大小便，流墮草上、或風吹、或鳥銜污草，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she has a certain illness, if she defecates or urinates in a place without grass and it flows down on grass, if a wind blows it there, or if a bird takes it in its beak and soils the grass, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 77th rule.)
