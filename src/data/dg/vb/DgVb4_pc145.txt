<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時長老迦毘羅比丘夜過已，晨朝著衣持鉢入舍衛城乞食。時諸比丘尼見迦毘羅即罵詈言：「此弊惡下賤工師種，壞我等塔除棄僧伽藍外。」</lzh>
Then the venerable Kapila bhikkhu, when the night had passed, in the morning, put on his robes, took his bowl, and entered Sāvatthī on almsround. When the bhikkhunīs saw Kapila, they abused him: “This wicked, lowly person from the worker class destroyed our stupa and threw it away outside the monastery.” 

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責言：「云何汝等乃罵長老迦毘羅？」呵責已往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責諸比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何罵迦毘羅耶？」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住。欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼罵比丘者，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked them: “Why did you abuse the venerable Kapila?” Having criticized them, they went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha and criticized these bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you abuse Kapila?” When he had criticized them in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī abuses a bhikkhu, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>罵者，下賤處生、種姓下賤、技術下賤、作業下賤、若說犯罪、若說汝有如是如是結使、或觸他所諱。彼比丘尼，種類罵比丘，乃至說他所諱。說而了了者，波逸提；不了了者，突吉羅。</lzh>
“Abusing” means about being born in a lowly place, being of a lowly caste, having lowly skills, a lowly profession, or saying that someone has committed an offense, or saying: “You’ve such-and-such defilements,” or touching on their sensitive points. If a bhikkhunī in such a way abuses a bhikkhu … touches on his sensitive points, and if she speaks and he understands, it’s a pācittiya. If he doesn’t understand, it’s a dukkaṭa. 

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，若戲笑語、若疾疾語、若獨語、若夢中語、欲說此乃錯說彼，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she says it jokingly, if she speaks quickly, if she speaks when she’s alone, if she speaks in a dream, or if she wants to say one thing but by mistake says something else, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 145th rule.)
