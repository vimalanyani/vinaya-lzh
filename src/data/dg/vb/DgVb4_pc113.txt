<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時世尊在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the World-honored One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時六群比丘尼，營理家事，舂磨、或炊飯、或炒麥、或煮食、或敷床臥具、或掃地、或取水、或受人使令。諸居士見已皆共嗤笑言：「如我婦營理家業，舂磨炊飯乃至受人使令，此六群比丘尼亦復如是。」時諸居士皆生慢心不復恭敬。</lzh>
Then the group-of-six bhikkhunīs performed household chores: grinding, boiling rice, roasting oats, cooking meals, laying out beds and bedding, sweeping the ground, fetching water, and taking instructions from others. When the householders saw them, they all laughed at them and said: “They perform household chores like our wives: grinding, boiling rice, … taking instructions from others. These group-of-six bhikkhunīs also do all this.” Then pride arose in the minds of all the householders, and they didn’t respect them anymore. 

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責六群比丘尼言：「云何營理家業，舂磨乃至受人使令，如俗人無異耶？」往白諸比丘，諸比丘白佛。佛以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責六群比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何營理家業，舂磨乃至受使，如俗人無異？」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼為白衣作使者，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “Why did you perform household chores: grinding, … and taking instructions from others? Are you no different from lay people?” They went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus told the Buddha. The Buddha for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha and criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you perform household chores: grinding, … and taking instructions? Are you no different from lay people?” When he had criticized them in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī carries out orders from a lay person, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>為白衣作使者，即上舂磨乃至受使者是。</lzh>
“Carrying out orders from a lay person” means as above: grinding, … and taking instructions.

<lzh>彼比丘尼營理家業，舂磨乃至受人使令者，一切波逸提。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī performs household chores: grinding, … and taking instructions from people, in all cases it’s a pācittiya.

<lzh>比丘，隨所犯；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, this is treated according to whatever he committed. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，若父母病、若被繫閉，為敷床臥具、掃地取水、供給所須受使；若有信心優婆塞病、若被繫閉，為敷床臥具、掃地取水受使；若為強力者所執，如是一切，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if her parents are sick or imprisoned and she lays out beds and bedding, sweeps the ground, fetches water, provides what is necessary, and takes instructions; if a faithful lay Buddhist is sick or imprisoned and she lays out beds and bedding, sweeps the ground, fetches water, and takes instructions; or if she’s held by force, in all these cases the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 113th rule.)
