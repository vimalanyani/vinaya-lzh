<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時六群比丘尼，與男子共入闇室中。諸居士見皆共譏嫌言：「此比丘尼，不知慚愧、犯不淨行。外自稱言：『我知正法。』如是何有正法？云何比丘尼，與男子共入闇室中，如婬女賊女無異？」</lzh>
Then the group-of-six bhikkhunīs entered a dark room together with men. When the householders saw it, they were all upsed and said: “These bhikkhunīs know no shame and they commit impure practices. Outwardly, they praise themselves: ‘We know the true dhamma’, how is that the true dhamma? Why do bhikkhunīs enter a dark room together with men? There’s no difference to prostitutes and criminals.”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責六群比丘尼：「汝等云何與男子共入闇室中？」時諸比丘尼往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊爾時以此因緣集比丘僧，訶責六群比丘尼：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何六群比丘尼，與男子共入闇室中？」時世尊以無數方便呵責六群比丘尼已，告諸比丘：「此六群比丘尼，多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，與男子共入闇室中者，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “Why did you enter a dark room together with men?” Then the bhikkhunīs went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why, group-of-six bhikkhunīs, did you enter a dark room together with men?” Then, when the World-honored One had criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These group-of-six bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī enters a dark room together with a man, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>闇室者，無燈火、無窓牖、無光明。</lzh>
“A dark room” means without a burning lamp, without a window, and without light.

<lzh>彼比丘尼與男子共入闇室中者，波逸提。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī enters a dark room together with a man, it’s a pācittiya.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，若有燈火嚮牖光明，若為強力者將入，若命難、或梵行難，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if there’s a burning lamp, a window, or light, if she’s held by force and made to enter, if her life is in danger, or if her celibacy is in danger, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 86th rule.)
