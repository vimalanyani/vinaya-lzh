<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時比丘尼眾得如法施衣欲分，時偷羅難陀多諸弟子分散行不在。時偷羅難陀作是意：「遮眾僧如法分衣，恐弟子不得。」諸比丘尼知如是意。</lzh>
Then the bhikkhunī sangha obtained a gift of robes according to dhamma and wanted to distribute them. Then Thullanandā’s many students were wandering in various places and weren’t there. Thullanandā thought: “I’ll obstruct the sangha from distributing the robes according to dhamma. I fear that my students won’t obtain any.” The bhikkhunīs got to know this intention.

<lzh>諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責偷羅難陀：「云何作是意：『遮眾僧如法分衣，恐弟子不得。』」時諸比丘尼往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責偷羅難陀：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何作是意：『遮眾僧如法分衣，恐弟子不得。』」時世尊以無數方便呵責偷羅難陀已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼作如是意：『眾僧如法分衣遮令不分，恐弟子不得。』者，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked Thullanandā: “Why did you think: ‘I’ll obstruct the sangha from distributing the robes according to dhamma. I fear that my students won’t obtain any.’?” Then the bhikkhunīs went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha and criticized Thullanandā: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you think: ‘I’ll obstruct the sangha from distributing the robes according to dhamma. I fear that my students won’t obtain any.’?” When the World-honored One had criticized Thullanandā in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “This bhikkhunī has all kinds of taints, and is the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī thinks: “The sangha is distributing robes according to dhamma. I’ll obstruct them and not let them distribute. I fear that my students won’t obtain any,” it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>眾僧者，如上。</lzh>
“Sangha” is as above.

<lzh>法者，如法如律、如佛所教。</lzh>
“Dhamma” means according to dhamma and vinaya, according to the Buddha’s teaching.

<lzh>衣者，有十種如上。</lzh>
“A robe” means there are 10 kinds, as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼作如是意：「眾僧如法分衣遮令不分，恐弟子不得。」波逸提。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī thinks: “The sangha is distributing robes according to dhamma. I’ll obstruct them and not let them distribute. I fear that my students won’t obtain any”, it’s a pācittiya.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，或非時分，非法別眾、非法和合眾、法別眾、似法別眾、似法和合眾、非法非律非佛所教，若欲分時恐失、若壞遮令不分，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if they distribute out-of-season, if it’s done against the dhamma in a divided assembly, if it’s done against the dhamma in a harmonious assembly, if it’s done according to dhamma in a divided assembly, if it’s done with what resembles dhamma in a divided assembly, if it’s done with what resembles dhamma in a harmonious assembly, if it’s done against the dhamma and vinaya, against the Buddha’s teaching, or if when they want to distribute, she fears that (the robes) will be lost or destroyed, and she obstructs it and doesn’t let them distribute, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 108th rule.)
