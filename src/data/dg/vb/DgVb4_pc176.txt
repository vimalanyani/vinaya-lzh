<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時六群比丘尼，著衣搖身趍行，為好故。時諸居士見皆譏嫌言：「此比丘尼等，不知慚愧犯梵行，外自稱言：『我知正法。』如是有何正法？為好故搖身趍行，猶若婬女賊女無異。」</lzh>
Then the group-of-six bhikkhunīs put on their robes and walked around swaying their bodies to look good. When the householders saw this, they were all upset and said: “These bhikkhunīs know no shame, they’ve broken celibacy. Outwardly, they praise themselves: ‘We know the true dhamma’, how is that the true dhamma? They walk around swaying their bodies to look good. There’s no difference to prostitutes and criminals.”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責六群比丘尼言：「汝等云何為好故搖身趍行，猶若婬女賊女無異？」時諸比丘尼白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責六群比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何比丘尼，為好故搖身趍行？」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，為好故搖身趍行者，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “Why did you walk around swaying your bodies to look good? There’s no difference to prostitutes and criminals.” Then the bhikkhunīs told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why, bhikkhunīs, did you walk around swaying your bodies to look good?” When he had criticized them in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī walks around swaying her body to look good, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼，為好故搖身趍行者，波逸提。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī walks around swaying her body to look good, it’s a pācittiya.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，或時有如是病，或為他所打避杖、或有暴象來、或遇賊、或遇惡獸、或有刺棘來以手遮、或渡河水、或渡溝渠汪水、若渡埿、或時欲齊整著衣、恐有高下參差象鼻多羅樹葉細攝皺、如是左右顧視搖身看，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she has a certain illness at that time, if when someone attacks her she avoids their staff, if a violent elephant comes, if she encounters a criminal or a savage animal, if there are thorny brambles and she holds them away with her hand, if she crosses a river, a ditch, or a pool of water, if she crosses mud, if when she wants to put on her robes neatly, she fears that the height is uneven, that it’s like an elepant’s trunk, a palm leaf, or in fine pleats, and therefore she inspects it all around and sways her body to look, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 176th rule.)
