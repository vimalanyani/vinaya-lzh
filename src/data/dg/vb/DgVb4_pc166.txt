<h2>First Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時有比丘尼度二形人，大小便時有比丘尼見，白諸比丘尼。</lzh>
Then there were bhikkhunīs who ordained intersex people. When they defecated and urinated, a bhikkhunī saw it and told the other bhikkhunīs.

<lzh>諸比丘尼聞，中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責諸比丘尼言：「汝等云何度他二形人？」即白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責諸比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何比丘尼乃度二形人？」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，度二形人授具足戒，波逸提。」如是世尊與比丘尼結戒。</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked these bhikkhunīs: “Why did you just ordain intersex people?” Then they told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha and criticized these bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why, bhikkhunīs, did you ordain intersex people?” When he had criticized them in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Preliminary Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī gives the full ordination to an intersex person, it’s a pācittiya.’” In this way the World-honored One laid down the precept for the bhikkhunīs.


<h2>Second Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>時諸比丘尼，不知二形、不二形，後方知有二形，或有作波逸提懺者，或有疑者。「不知，無犯。自今已去當如是結戒：若比丘尼，知二形人與授具足戒者，波逸提。」</lzh>
Then the bhikkhunīs didn’t know if someone was intersex or not. They only found out later that someone was intersex. Some confessed a pācittiya. Some had doubts. The Buddha said: “If you don’t know, there’s no offense. From now on, you should recite the precept like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī knows that someone is intersex, and gives them the full ordination, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>二形者，男形女形。</lzh>
“Intersex” means the male sex and the female sex.

<lzh>彼比丘尼，知二形人與授具足戒，三羯磨竟，和上尼波逸提。白二羯磨竟，三突吉羅。白一羯磨竟，二突吉羅。白已，一突吉羅。白未竟，突吉羅。未白前剃髮與授戒集眾眾滿，一切突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī knows that someone is intersex, and gives them the full ordination, when they’ve carried out the three announcements, the preceptor commits a pācittiya. When they’ve carried out the motion and two announcements, it’s three dukkaṭas. When they’ve carried out the motion and one announcement, it’s two dukkaṭas. When they’ve carried out the motion, it’s one dukkaṭa. If the motion hasn’t yet been finished, it’s a dukkaṭa. If they haven’t yet done the motion, when they shave their head, when they give them the precepts, when they gather the sangha, or when the assembly is complete, in all cases it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，先不知，若信彼人語、若信可信者語、若信父母語與授具足戒已，後變為二形，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she doesn’t know at first, if she believes that person’s words, if she believes a trustworthy person’s words, if she believes their parents’ words, or if she gives them the full ordination, and (the new bhikkhunī) later turns into an intersex person, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 166th rule.)
