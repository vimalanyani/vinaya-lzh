<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時王波斯匿邊界人民反叛。時六群比丘尼，於彼人間有疑恐怖處遊行。時諸賊見已作是言：「此六群比丘尼，皆為波斯匿王所供養，我等當共觸嬈。」時諸居士見已皆譏嫌言：「此比丘尼，無有慚愧皆犯梵行。外自稱言：『我修正法。』如是有何正法？於邊界人間恐怖處遊行，與賊女婬女無異。」</lzh>
Then the people in a remote area of King Pasenadi’s territory rebelled. The group-of-six bhikkhunīs wandered among those people in a dubious, frightening place. When the bandits saw them, they said: “These group-of-six bhikkhunīs are all supported by King Pasenadi. We’ll molest them.” When the householders saw this, they were all upset and said: “These bhikkhunīs have no shame and they all break their celibacy. Outwardly, they praise themselves: ‘We know the true dhamma’, how is that the true dhamma? They wander among the people in a remote area in a frightening place. There’s no difference to criminals and prostitutes.”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，呵責六群比丘尼：「汝等云何於人間恐怖處遊行？」即往白諸比丘，諸比丘白佛。佛爾時以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責六群比丘尼：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何汝等在人間恐怖處遊行？」爾時世尊以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，邊界有疑恐怖處人間遊行者，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “Why did you wander among the people in a frightening place?” Then they went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus told the Buddha. The Buddha then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you wander among the people in a frightening place?” When the World-honored One had criticized them in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī wanders among the people in a dubious, frightening place in a remote area, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>邊界者，遠城處。</lzh>
“A remote area” means a place far from the fortified cities.

<lzh>有疑者，疑有賊盜。</lzh>
“Dubious” means dubious because there are bandits.

<lzh>恐怖者，恐有賊盜。</lzh>
“Frightening” means frightening because there are bandits.

<lzh>彼比丘尼，於邊界有疑恐怖處遊行，隨入村行一一界，一一波逸提。無村阿蘭若處行十里，一波逸提。行減一村、減十里，一突吉羅。若村中行一界內，突吉羅。方便欲去共期而不去，一切突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī wanders in a dubious, frightening place in a remote area, whenever she enters a village and walks from one territory to the next, each is a pācittiya. If there’s no village and she walks 10 leagues in the wilderness, it’s a pācittiya. If she walks less than the distance of a village, or less than 10 leagues, it’s a dukkaṭa. If within one village, she walks in one territory, it’s a dukkaṭa. If she plans and wants to go, or if she makes an appointment, but doesn’t go, in all cases it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，若被喚、若被請、若有所白、若為強力者所執、若被繫縛、或命難、梵行難，若先至後有疑恐怖事起者，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s summoned, if she’s invited, if there’s a message to convey, if she’s held by force, if she’s arrested, if her life is in danger, if her celibacy is in danger, or if she goes there first and later a dubious, frightening situaton arises, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 97th rule.)
