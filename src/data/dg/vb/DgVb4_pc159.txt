<h2>First Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時六群比丘尼乘乘在道行。諸居士見皆譏嫌言：「此比丘尼，不知慚愧犯梵行，外自稱言：『我知正法。』如是有何正法？乘乘而行，如婬女賊女無異。」</lzh>
Then the group-of-six bhikkhunīs went on a road riding in a vehicle. When the householders saw this, they were all upset and said: “These bhikkhunīs know no shame, they’ve broken celibacy. Outwardly, they praise themselves: ‘We know the true dhamma’, how is that the true dhamma? They go around riding in a vehicle. There’s no difference to prostitutes and criminals.”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責六群比丘尼言：「汝云何乘乘在道行？」即白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責六群比丘尼：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何比丘尼乘乘行？」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼乘乘在道行者，波逸提。」如是世尊與比丘尼結戒。</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “Why did you go on a road riding in a vehicle?” Then they told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why, bhikkhunīs, did you go around riding in a vehicle?” When he had criticized them in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Preliminary Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī goes on a road riding in a vehicle, it’s a pācittiya.’” In this way the World-honored One laid down the precept for the bhikkhunīs.


<h2>Second Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>時諸比丘尼有老者，或羸病氣力微弱，不能從此住處至彼住處。佛言：「自今已去聽乘步挽乘一切女乘。」時諸比丘尼，有難事或命難、梵行難，疑不敢乘乘走。佛言：「自今已去有如是諸難事聽乘乘去。自今已去當如是說戒：若比丘尼，無病乘乘行，除時因緣，波逸提。」</lzh>
Then there were bhikkhunīs who were old, or weak, sick, and with low energy. They couldn’t go from one residence to another. The Buddha said: “From now on, I allow to ride in a rickshaw, or in a vehicle with only females<note> Possibly this means only drawn by female animals, as in the parallel rules of other schools</note>.” Then the bhikkhunīs had difficulties, or their lives were in danger, or their celibacy was in danger. They had doubts and didn’t dare to ride in a vehicle to escape. The Buddha said: “From now on, if there are such difficulties, I allow to ride in a vehicle to leave. From now on, you should recite the precept like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī, who isn’t sick, goes around riding in a vehicle, except at a suitable time for a good reason, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>乘者有四種：象乘、馬乘、車乘、步乘。</lzh>
“A vehicle” means there are four kinds: an elephant, a horse, a carriage, and a rickshaw.

<lzh>彼比丘尼，無病乘乘行，隨所行村界，一一波逸提。若無村阿蘭若處，行十里一波逸提。減一村界、若減十里，突吉羅。若行一家界內，突吉羅。方便欲去而不去，共期去而不去，一切突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī, who isn’t sick, goes around riding in a vehicle, whenever she reaches the territory of a village, each village is a pācittiya. Whenever she goes 10 leagues in the wilderness where there’s no village, it’s a pācittiya. If she goes less than the distance of a village territory, or less than 10 leagues, it’s a dukkaṭa. If she goes within the territory of one family, it’s a dukkaṭa. If she plans and wants to go but doesn’t go, or if she makes an appointment to go but doesn’t go, in all cases it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，或時有如是病乘種種安乘；若命難、梵行難乘乘走；或為強力所執將去者，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she has a certain illness at that time and she rides in all kinds of female(-drawn) vehicles, if her life is in danger, or if her celibacy is in danger and she rides in a vehicle to escape, or if she’s held by force and made to go, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 159th rule.)
