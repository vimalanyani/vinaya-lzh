<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>爾時六群比丘尼，往觀王宮畫堂園林浴池。諸居士見皆共譏嫌：「此諸比丘尼，不知慚愧犯梵行，外自稱言：『我知正法。』如是有何正法？乃往觀王宮、畫堂、園林、浴池，如賊女婬女無異。」</lzh>
Then the group-of-six bhikkhunīs went to see a royal palace, a picture gallery, a garden, and a swimming pool. When the householders saw it, they were all upset: “These bhikkhunīs know no shame and they break their celibacy. Outwardly, they praise themselves: ‘We know the true dhamma’, how is that the true dhamma? Then they go to see a royal palace, a picture gallery, a garden, and a swimming pool. There’s no difference to criminals and prostitutes.” “
<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責六群比丘尼：「汝云何乃往觀王宮、畫堂、園林、浴池？」爾時諸比丘尼往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白佛。佛爾時以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責六群比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何六群比丘尼乃往觀王宮、畫堂、園林、浴池？」世尊以無數方便呵責六群比丘尼已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼往觀王宮文飾、畫堂、園林、浴池者，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “Why did you go to see a royal palace, a picture gallery, a garden, and a swimming pool?” Then the bhikkhunīs went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the Buddha. The Buddha then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why, group-of-six bhikkhunīs, did you go to see a royal palace, a picture gallery, a garden, and a swimming pool?” When the World-honored One had criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī goes to see a royal palace, a decorated picture gallery, a garden, or a swimming pool, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>若比丘尼往觀王宮、文飾、畫堂、園林、浴池，從道至道、從道至非道、從非道至道、從高至下、從下至高，去而見者，波逸提。不見者，突吉羅。方便欲去而不去，若共期去而不去，一切突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī goes to see a royal palace, a decorated picture gallery, a garden, or a swimming pool, whether by going from a road to another road, or by leaving a road and going off-road, or by going from off-road to a road, or by going down from above, or by going up from below, and if she goes and sees it, it’s a pācittiya. If she doesn’t see it, it’s a dukkaṭa. If she plans and wants to go but doesn’t go, or if she makes an appointment to go but doesn’t go, in all cases it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，若入王宮有所白、若喚若請、若路由中過、若寄宿、若為強力者所執、或被縛將去、或命難、梵行難；</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she enters a royal palace because there’s a message to convey, if she’s summoned, if she’s invited, if the road passes through there, if it’s in her residence, if she’s held by force, if she’s arrested and made to go, if her life is in danger, or if her celibacy is in danger; 

<lzh>若復為僧事塔事而往觀看畫堂，欲取摸法，不犯。</lzh>
or else if she goes to see a picture gallery for a sangha matter or a stupa matter, or because she wants to get a grasp of the dhamma, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>若至僧伽藍中受教授聽法，或被請道由中過，若寄宿，或為強力者所執，或被縛將去，或為僧事、塔事往觀園林浴池欲取摸法者，不犯。</lzh>
If she goes to a monastery to receive instruction and listen to dhamma, if she’s invited, if the road passes through there, if her residence is there, if she’s held by force, if she’s arrested and made to go, if she goes to see a garden or a swimming pool for sangha matter or a stupa matter, or because she wants to get a grasp of the dhamma, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 100th rule.)
