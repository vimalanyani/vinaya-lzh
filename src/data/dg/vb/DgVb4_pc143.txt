<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼，在無比丘處夏安居，教授日無受教授處，有所疑無可諮問。</lzh>
Then the bhikkhunīs spent the rains retreat in a place without bhikkhus. On the instruction day, there was no place to receive instruction from, and those who had doubts had nobody to consult.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，呵責諸比丘尼言：「云何乃在無有比丘處夏安居，教授日無受教授處。若有所疑事而無可諮問處？」即白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責諸比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何乃於無比丘處夏安居，乃至有所疑事而無可諮問耶？」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，在無比丘處夏安居者，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They criticized these bhikkhunīs: “Why did you spend the rains retreat in a place without bhikkhus? On the instruction day, there was no place to receive instruction from, and if there were doubts about something you had no place to consult.” Then they told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha and criticized these bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you spend the rains retreat in a place without bhikkhus? … if there were doubts about something you had nobody to consult.” When he had criticized them in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī spends the rains retreat in a place without bhikkhus, it’s a pācittiya.’”

<lzh>比丘尼義如上說。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼，無比丘處夏安居者，波逸提。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī spends the rains retreat in a place without bhikkhus, it’s a pācittiya.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，有比丘處夏安居；若依比丘僧夏安居；其間命過者、若遠行去、若休道、或為賊所將去、或為惡獸所害、或為水所漂，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she spends the rains retreat in a place with bhikkhus, if she spends the rains retreat in dependence on the bhikkhu sangha, but during that time they pass away, or go on a long journey, or disrobe, or if she’s abducted by criminals, harmed by a savage animal, or washed away by water, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 143rd rule.)
