<lzh>三十捨墮法</lzh>
<h2>The 30 pācittiya rules with relinquishment</h2>


<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時佛在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。時世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，告諸比丘：「自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如此說：</lzh>
At that time, the Buddha was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park. Then the World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and said to the bhikkhus: “From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this:


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>若比丘尼，衣已竟、迦絺那衣已捨，畜長衣經十日不淨施得持。若過，尼薩耆波逸提。」(一竟)</lzh>
“If a bhikkhunī has finished her robes, has relinquished the kaṭhina robe, and stores spare cloth for 10 days without making a pure offering<note> vikappana</note>, she may keep it. If she keeps it longer, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. (End of the first rule.)

<lzh>若比丘尼，衣已竟、迦絺那衣已捨，五衣中若離一一衣異處宿經一夜，除僧羯磨，尼薩耆波逸提。(二竟)</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī has finished her robes, has relinquished the kaṭhina robe, and stays in another place away from any of her five robes overnight, unless the sangha has carried out a formal act, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. (End of the second rule.)

<lzh>若比丘尼，衣已竟、迦絺那衣已捨，若得非時衣欲須便受，受已疾疾成衣。若足者善，若不足者得畜一月，為滿足故。若過畜者，尼薩耆波逸提(三竟)</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī has finished her robes, has relinquished the kaṭhina robe, and obtains out-of-season cloth, she should accept it if she wants or needs it. Having accepted it, she should quickly turn it into a robe. If it’s enough, it’s fine. If it’s not enough, she may store it for one month in order to complete it. If she stores it longer, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. (End of the third rule.)

<lzh>若比丘尼，從非親里居士、居士婦乞衣，除餘時，尼薩耆波逸提。是中時者，若奪衣、失衣、燒衣、漂衣，是名時。(四竟)</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī asks for a robe from an unrelated male or female householder, except at a suitable time, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. This is a suitable time: If the robe has been stolen, lost, burnt, or washed away. This is called the suitable time. (End of the fourth rule.)

<lzh>若比丘尼，奪衣、失衣、燒衣、漂衣，是非親里居士、若居士婦自恣請多與衣，是比丘尼當知足受衣。若過，尼薩耆波逸提。(五竟)</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī’s robe has been stolen, lost, burnt, or washed away, and that unrelated male or female householder invites her and gives many robes, that bhikkhunī should know what is sufficient when accepting robes. If she exceeds that, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. (End of the fifth rule.)

<lzh>若居士、居士婦為比丘尼辦衣價，買如是衣與某甲比丘尼，是比丘尼先不受自恣請，到居士家作如是說：「善哉居士！為我辦如是如是衣價與我，為好故。」若得衣者，尼薩耆波逸提(六竟)</lzh>
If a male or female householder prepares a robe fund for a bhikkhunī, to buy a certain kind of robe for bhikkhunī So-and-so, and if that bhikkhunī without having first received an invitation, goes to the householder’s home and says: ‘It’d be good, householder, to prepare for me such-and-such a robe fund to give to me,’ in order to get something good, and if she obtains the robe, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. (End of the sixth rule.)

<lzh>若二居士、居士婦與比丘尼辦衣價，我曹辦如是衣價，與某甲比丘尼。是比丘尼先不受自恣請，到二居士家作如是言：「善哉居士！辦如是如是衣價與我，共作一衣，為好故。」若得衣，尼薩耆波逸提。(七竟)</lzh>
If two male or female householders prepare a robe fund for a bhikkhunī: ‘We’ve prepared such-and-such a robe fund for bhikkhunī So-and-so,’ and if that bhikkhunī without having first received an invitation, goes to the two householders’ homes and says: ‘It’d be good, householders, to prepare such-and-such a robe fund for me. Make one robe together,’ in order to get something good, and if she obtains the robe, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. (End of the seventh rule.)

<lzh>若比丘尼，若王、若大臣、若婆羅門、若居士、居士婦，遣使為比丘尼送衣價，持如是衣價與某甲比丘尼。彼使至比丘尼所語言：「阿姨！為汝送衣價，受取。」是比丘尼語彼使如是言：「我不應受此衣價，我若須衣，合時清淨當受。」彼使語比丘尼言：「阿姨！有執事人不？」須衣比丘尼言：「有！若僧伽藍民、若優婆塞，此是比丘尼執事人，常為比丘尼執事。」彼使至執事人所，與衣價已，還到比丘尼所如是言：「阿姨！所示某甲執事人，我已與衣價。大姊！知時往彼當得衣。」比丘尼若須衣者，當往彼執事人所二反、三反語言：「我須衣。」若二反、三反為作憶念得衣者善，若不得衣，四反、五反、六反在前默然住令彼憶念。若四反、五反、六反在前默然住得衣者善，若不得衣，過是求得衣者，尼薩耆波逸提。若不得衣，隨使所來處，若自往、若遣使往語言：「汝先遣使持衣價，與某甲比丘尼，是比丘尼竟不得，汝還取莫使失，此是時。」(八竟)</lzh>
If there is a bhikkhunī, and if a king, a high official, a brahmin, a male or a female householder sends a messenger with a robe fund for the bhikkhunī: ‘Take such a robe fund and give it to bhikkhunī So-and-so,’ and if that messenger goes to the bhikkhunī and says: ‘Venerable, this robe fund has been sent for you, receive it,’ the bhikkhunī should say to the messenger: ‘I shouldn’t accept this robe fund. If I need a robe, I’ll accept something pure at the right time.’ If the messenger says to the bhikkhunī: ‘Venerable, do you have a manager?’, the bhikkhunī who needs a robe should say: ‘I do. Either a monastery attendant or a lay person, these are the bhikkhunīs’ managers, who often manage things for the bhikkhunīs.’ After having gone to the manager and given them the robe fund, the messenger returns to the bhikkhunī and says: ‘Venerable, I’ve given the robe fund to the manager So-and-so you indicated. Venerable, when you know that the right time has come, you should go to them and receive a robe.’ If that bhikkhunī needs a robe, she should go to that manager and say two or three times: ‘I need a robe.’ If at the second or third time of reminding them, she obtains a robe, it’s fine. If she doesn’t obtain a robe, she may stand silently in front of them for a fourth, fifth, and sixth time to make them remember. If at the fourth, fifth, and sixth time of silently standing in front of them, she obtains the robe, it’s fine. If she doesn’t obtain the robe, and continues to seek to obtain it, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. If she doesn’t obtain the robe, she should either go herself to the place where the messenger came from, or send a messenger there to say: ‘You previously sent a messenger holding a robe fund for bhikkhunī So-and-so. In the end, the bhikkhunī hasn’t obtained it. You should take it back, don’t let it be lost.’ This is the procedure. (End of the eighth rule.)

If a bhikkhunī keeps a bowl with less than five repairs that doesn’t leak, and asks for a new bowl, in order to get something good, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. That bhikkhunī should take that bowl and relinquish it in the midst of the bhikkhunī sangha. Afterwards, it’s exchanged in order down to the most junior bhikkhunī. The junior bhikkhunī’s bowl is given to that bhikkhunī, and it’s said: ‘Younger sister, keep this bowl until it breaks.’ This is the procedure. (End of the 12th rule.)

Weave it very well, make it wide, long, strong, fine, neat, and good. I’ll give you some compensation,’ and if that bhikkhunī then gives a compensation, even just one meal, and she obtains the robe, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. (End of the 14th rule.)
