<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼眾僧如法出迦絺那衣，六群比丘尼作是念：「令眾僧今不出迦絺那衣，後當出。令五事久得放捨。」時諸比丘尼知六群比丘尼作如是意：「令眾僧今不出迦絺那衣，欲令五事久得放捨。」</lzh>
Then the bhikkhunī sangha removed the kaṭhina robe according to dhamma. The group-of-six bhikkhunīs thought: “We won’t let the sangha remove the kaṭhina robe now. It should be removed later. We’ll obtain release from the five things for a long time.” Then the bhikkhunīs got to know that the group-of-six bhikkhunīs had thought: “We won’t let the sangha remove the kaṭhina robe now. We want to obtain release from the five things for a long time.”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，呵責六群比丘尼言：「汝云何作是意：『令眾僧今不出迦絺那衣，欲令五事久得放捨。』耶？」諸比丘尼白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集諸比丘僧，呵責六群比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何作如是意：『令眾僧今不出迦絺那衣，欲令五事久得放捨。』」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此六群比丘尼！多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼作如是意：『令眾僧今不得出迦絺那衣，後當出欲令五事久得放捨。』波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “Why did you think: ‘We won’t let the sangha remove the kaṭhina robe now. We want to obtain release from the five things for a long time.’?” The bhikkhunīs told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha and criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you think: ‘We won’t let the sangha remove the kaṭhina robe now. We want to obtain release from the five things for a long time.’?” When he had criticized them in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These group-of-six bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī thinks: “I won’t let the sangha remove the kaṭhina robe now. It should be removed later. I want to obtain release from the five things for a long time,” it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>僧者，如上。</lzh>
“Sangha” is as above.

<lzh>法者，如法如律、如佛所教。</lzh>
“Dhamma” means according to dhamma and vinaya, according to the Buddha’s teaching.

<lzh>彼比丘尼作如是意：「停眾僧如法出迦絺那衣，欲令五事久得放捨。」者，波逸提。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī thinks: “I’ll stop the sangha from removing the kaṭhina robe according to dhamma. I want to obtain release from the five things for a long time”, it’s a pācittiya.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，若非時出，非法別眾、非法和合眾、法別眾、似法別眾、似法和合眾、非法非律非佛所教、若出時恐失、壞遮令不出，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if they remove it out-of-season, if it’s done against the dhamma in a divided assembly, if it’s done against the dhamma in a harmonious assembly, if it’s done according to dhamma in a divided assembly, if it’s done with what resembles dhamma in a divided assembly, if it’s done with what resembles dhamma in a harmonious assembly, if it’s done against the dhamma and vinaya, against the Buddha’s teaching, or if when they remove it, she fears that it’ll be lost or destroyed, and she obstructs it and doesn’t let them remove it, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 109th rule.)
