<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在釋翅搜迦毘羅國尼拘律園中。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was among the Sakyans in Kapilavatthu, in the Banyan tree park.

<lzh>時跋陀羅迦毘羅比丘尼，身生癰使男子破之。此比丘尼身細軟如天身無異，時男子手觸身覺細滑生染著，便前捉欲犯，即便高聲言：「勿爾！勿爾！」時左右比丘尼聞其聲皆來問言：「向何故大喚耶？」即具說因緣。</lzh>
Then an abscess had appeared on Bhaddā Kāpilānī bhikkhunī’s body, and she had a man open it. This bhikkhunī’s body was slender and soft, no different from the body of a heavenly being. When the man touched her body with his hand and realized how smooth it was, defiled attachment arose in him. He grabbed her from the front and wanted to rape her. Then she loudly called out: “Don’t do that! Don’t do that!” When the bhikkhunīs around heard her voice, they all came and asked: “Why do you scream so loudly?” Then she fully explained the reason.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責跋陀羅迦毘羅言：「云何比丘尼乃使男子破癰耶？」即白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責跋陀羅迦毘羅比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何使男子破身癰瘡耶？」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，身生癰及種種瘡，不白眾及餘人，輒使男子破若裹者，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked Bhaddā Kāpilānī: “Why does a bhikkhunī have a man open an abscess?” Then they told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized Bhaddā Kāpilānī bhikkhunī: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you have a man open an abscess on your body?” When he had criticized her in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “This bhikkhunī has all kinds of taints, and is the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī, on whose body an abscess or any kind of wound has appeared, without informing the sangha or another person, just has a man open it or bandage it, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>僧者亦如上。</lzh>
“Sangha” is also as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼，若身生癰及種種瘡，不白眾使男子破，一下刀，一波逸提。若裹時，一匝纏，一波逸提。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī, on whose body an abscess or any kind of wound has appeared, without informing the sangha, has a man open it, every cut with the knive is one pācittiya. If she has it bandaged, every time the bandage is wrapped around is one pācittiya.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，白眾僧使男子破癰若瘡、若裹，若為強力者所執，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she informs the sangha and has a man open an abscess or wound, or has him bandage it, or if she’s held by force, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 147th rule.)
