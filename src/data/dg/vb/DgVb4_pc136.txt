<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時偷蘭難陀比丘尼語式叉摩那言：「汝學是捨是，我當授汝具足戒。」彼報言：「爾。」彼式叉摩那聰明智慧堪能勸化。時偷蘭難陀作是意：「欲令式叉摩那久作勸化供養故不與，作方便料理時與受具足戒。」時式叉摩那嫌責偷蘭難陀：「偷蘭難陀語我言：『汝捨是學是，我當授汝具足戒。』而至今不為我作方便時授具足戒耶？」</lzh>
Then Thullanandā bhikkhunī said to a sikkhamānā: “Train in this, abandon that, and I’ll give you the full ordination.” She replied: “Okay.” The sikkhamānā was intelligent and wise, and capable of encouraging others. Then Thullanandā thought: “I want to have this sikkhamānā encourage and support me for a long time, therefore I won’t make plans and arrange a time to give her the full ordination.” Then the sikkhamānā rebuked Thullanandā: “Thullanandā said to me: ‘Abandon this, train in that. I’ll give you the full ordination’, but until now she hasn’t made plans for a time to give me the full ordination.”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責偷蘭難陀言：「汝云何語式叉摩那言：『汝捨是學是，我當授汝具足戒。』而不與授具足戒耶？」即往白諸比丘，諸比丘白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責偷蘭難陀「汝云何語式叉摩那言：『汝捨是學是，我當授汝具足戒。』云何不與授具足戒耶？」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼語式叉摩那言：『汝妹！捨是學是，我當與汝授具足戒。』若不方便與授具足戒，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked Thullanandā: “Why did you say to a sikkhamānā: ‘Abandon this, train in that, and I’ll give you the full ordination’, but didn’t give her the full ordination?” Then they went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha and criticized Thullanandā: “Why did you say to a sikkhamānā: ‘Abandon this, train in that, and I’ll give you the full ordination’? Why didn’t you give her the full ordination?” When he had criticized her in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “This bhikkhunī has all kinds of taints, and is the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī says to a sikkhamānā: “Younger sister, abandon this, train in that, and I’ll give you the full ordination,” but if she doesn’t make plans to give her the full ordination, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼語式叉摩那言：「汝妹！捨是學是，我當與汝授具足戒。」後不方便與授具足戒者，波逸提。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī says to a sikkhamānā: ‘Younger sister, abandon this, train in that, and I’ll give you the full ordination,’ but later doesn’t make plans to give her the full ordination, it’s a pācittiya.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，若許與授具足戒便與授具足戒，若彼病、若更無共活者、若無五衣、若無十眾，若缺戒、若破戒、若破見、破威儀，若被舉、若滅擯、若應滅擯，由是命難、梵行難，不與作方便授具足戒，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she promises to give the full ordination and then gives the full ordination, if she’s sick, if they then don’t live together, if there are no five robes, if there’s no assembly of 10, if (the sikkhamānā) is deficient in the precepts, breaks the precepts, breaks right view, breaks proper conduct, if she has been suspended, has been permanently expelled, or should be permanently expelled, if (the bhikkhunī’s) life is in danger because of this, or if her celibacy is in danger, and she doesn’t make plans to give her the full ordination, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 136th rule.)
