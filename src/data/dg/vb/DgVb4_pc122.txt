<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼，聞世尊制戒年十八、二歲學戒，滿二十受具足戒。彼非是十八、不二歲學戒，年滿二十與授具足戒。闕二歲學戒，彼受具足戒已，不知當學何戒？</lzh>
Then the bhikkhunīs heard that the World-honored One had laid down a precept that 18 year-olds who have trained in the (sikkhamānā) precepts for two years may receive the full ordination when they’re 20. They gave the full ordination to 20 year-olds who hadn’t trained for two years in the precepts since they were 18. Lacking the two-year training in the precepts, they, after having received the full ordination, didn’t know which precepts they should train in.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，呵責諸比丘尼言：「世尊制戒年十八、二歲學戒，滿二十與授具足戒。汝云何非是年十八，不二歲學戒，年二十便與授具足戒，闕二歲學戒而不知當學何戒耶？」時諸比丘尼往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責諸比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。世尊制戒年十八與二歲學戒，滿二十受具足戒。汝云何非是年十八，不二歲學戒，滿二十受具足戒。闕二歲學戒，受具足戒已，不知當學何戒耶？」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They criticized these bhikkhunīs: “The World-honored One has laid down a precept that 18 year-olds who have trained in the precepts for two years may receive the full ordination when they’re 20. Why did you give the full ordination to 20 year-olds who hadn’t trained for two years in the precepts since they were 18? Lacking the two-year training in the precepts, they didn’t know which precepts they should train in.” Then the bhikkhunīs went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha and criticized these bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. The World-honored One has laid down a precept that 18 year-olds who have trained in the precepts for two years may receive the full ordination when they’re 20. Why did you give the full ordination to 20 year-olds who hadn’t trained for two years in the precepts since they were 18? Lacking the two-year training in the precepts, they, after having received the full ordination, didn’t know which precepts they should train in.” 

<lzh>爾時世尊以無數方便呵責諸比丘尼已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼年十八童女，不與二歲學戒，年滿二十便與授具足戒者，波逸提。」</lzh>
Then, when the World-honored One had criticized the bhikkhunīs in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī doesn’t give the training precepts to an 18 year old girl for two years, but when she’s 20 still gives her the full ordination, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼若年十八童女，不二歲學戒，便與授具足戒，唱三羯磨竟，和上尼，波逸提。白二羯磨竟，三突吉羅。白一羯磨，二突吉羅。白已，一突吉羅。白未竟，突吉羅。未白前集眾及眾滿者，一切突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī, when an 18 year old girl hasn’t trained for two years in the precepts, still gives her the full ordination, when they’ve proclaimed the three announcements, the preceptor commits a pācittiya. When they’ve carried out the motion and two announcements, it’s three dukkaṭas. When they’ve carried out the motion and one announcement, it’s two dukkaṭas. When they’ve carried out the motion, it’s one dukkaṭa. If the motion hasn’t yet been finished, it’s a dukkaṭa. If they haven’t yet done the motion, when they gather the sangha, or when the assembly is complete, in all cases it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，年十八童女，二歲學戒，滿二十與授具足戒，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if an 18 year old girl trains for two years in the precepts and she gives her the full ordination when she’s 20, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 122nd rule.)
