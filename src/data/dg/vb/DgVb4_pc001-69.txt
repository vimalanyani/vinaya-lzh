If a bhikkhunī says: “I understand that in the dhamma spoken by the Buddha, engaging in sexual desire isn’t something that obstructs the path”, the bhikkhunīs should admonish this bhikkhunī: “Venerable sister, don’t say this.

Sāmaṇerī, the World-honored One explained in countless ways that sexual desire is something that obstructs the path. Engaging in sexual desire is something that obstructs the path.” If when the bhikkhunīs admonish that sāmaṇerī, she holds firmly on to it and doesn’t give it up, the bhikkhunīs should criticize and admonish her up to three times to give up this matter. If she gives it up by the third admonishment, it’s fine. If not, the bhikkhunīs should say to that sāmaṇerī: “From now on, you’re no longer a disciple of the Buddha. You may not follow the other bhikkhunīs. Other sāmaṇerīs may stay overnight with the bhikkhunīs for two nights. You now may not do this. Go away! Leave!

If a bhikkhunī, when the precepts are being recited, says: “Venerable sisters, I now only realized that this precept comes up in the precepts sutta that’s recited every half-month”, and the other bhikkhunīs know that that bhikkhunī has already sat in the precepts recitation two or three times, let alone more, that bhikkhunī without knowledge and without understanding should be dealt with according to the rule if she has committed an offense. And they should also add a reprimand for not knowing the rule: “Venerable sister, this is no gain for you, you’ve obtained what is unwholesome. When the precepts are being recited, you don’t use your mind to remember, and don’t single-mindedly lend an ear to hear the rules.” Because she doesn’t know, it’s a pācittiya. (57)

If there’s a jewel or an item decorated with jewels in a monastery or her residence and she picks it up herself or instruct others to pick it up, (she should think): “If someone remembers it, they’ll take it back”. This is the reason, there’s no other. (66)
