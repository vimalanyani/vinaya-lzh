<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時有伽羅旃陀輸那比丘尼，是出家外道女姊。時彼比丘尼，使此外道妹香塗摩身。諸居士見皆共嗤笑言：「此比丘尼，無有慚愧犯梵行，外自稱言：『我知正法。』如是有何正法？使外道妹香塗摩身，如婬女賊女無異。」</lzh>
Then there was Kālā-Chandāsaññā bhikkhunī, who was the older sister of a woman gone forth as a non-Buddhist renunciate. That bhikkhunī then had her non-Buddhist renunciate sister apply perfume on her body. When the householders saw this, they laughed at her and said: “This bhikkhunī has no shame, she has broken celibacy. Outwardly, she praises herself: ‘I know the true dhamma’, how is that the true dhamma? She has her non-Buddhist renunciate sister apply perfume on her body. There’s no difference to prostitutes and criminals.”

<lzh>諸比丘尼聞，中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，呵責伽羅旃陀輸那比丘尼言：「汝云何乃使外道妹香塗摩身耶？」呵責已即白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責伽羅旃陀輸那比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何比丘尼，乃使外道妹香塗摩身？」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，使外道女香塗摩身，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They criticized Kālā-Chandāsaññā bhikkhunī: “Why did you have your non-Buddhist renunciate sister apply perfume on your body?” Having criticized her, they told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized Kālā-Chandāsaññā bhikkhunī: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why, bhikkhunī, did you have your non-Buddhist renunciate sister apply perfume on your body?” When he had criticized her in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “This bhikkhunī has all kinds of taints, and is the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī has a non-Buddhist female renunciate apply perfume on her body, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼，使外道女香塗摩身者，波逸提。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī has a non-Buddhist female renunciate apply perfume on her body, it’s a pācittiya.’”

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，或時有如是病，或為強力者所執，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she has a certain illness at that time, or if she’s held by force, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain.
