<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時世尊在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。時有大豪貴長者，名大善鹿樂，顏貌端政，偷羅難陀比丘尼亦顏貌端政。長者鹿樂繫心於偷羅難陀所，偷羅難陀亦繫心於長者所。後於異時，為偷羅難陀故，請諸比丘尼及偷羅難陀設食，即於其夜辦具種種飲食，清旦往白時到。偷羅難陀知長者為己故請僧，彼即自住寺不往。諸比丘尼到時著衣持鉢詣長者家就坐已，時長者遍觀尼眾不見偷羅難陀，即問：「偷羅難陀何處而不來耶？」答言：「在寺不來。」於是長者疾疾行食已，即往寺中至偷羅難陀所。偷羅難陀遙見長者來即臥床上，長者前問：「阿姨何所患苦？」答言：「無所患苦，我所欲者而彼不欲。」彼言：「我欲非不欲。」時長者即前抱臥以手摩捉嗚，長者還坐問言：「阿姨所須何物？」答言：「我欲得酸棗。」</lzh>
At that time, the World-honored One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park. Then, there was a great, high-ranking householder, called Migāranatta the Meritorious One, who was good-looking. Thullanandā bhikkhunī also was good-looking. The householder Migāranatta’s mind was attached to Thullanandā, and Thullanandā’s mind was also attached to the householder. At a later time, for Thullanandā’s sake, he invited the bhikkhunīs and Thullanandā for a meal. The night before, he fully prepared all kinds of food and drinks, and at dawn, he went and informed them that the time had come. Thullanandā knew that the householder had invited the sangha for her own sake, and she then stayed in the monastery and didn’t go. When the right time had come and the bhikkhunīs had put on their robes, taken their bowls, gone to the householder’s home, and sat down, the householder observed the entire bhikkhunī sangha, but didn’t see Thullanandā. Then he asked: “Where is Thullanandā? Doesn’t she come?” They answered: “She’s in the monastery, and doesn’t come.” At this, the householder quickly served the meal, and then went to the monastery to Thullanandā. When Thullanandā saw the householder coming in the distance, she lay down on the bed. The householder first asked: “Venerable, what do you suffer from?” She answered: “I don’t suffer from anything. The one I want doesn’t want me.” He said: “I want you. I don’t not want you.” Then the householder hugged her from the front, lay down, touched her with his hand, held, and kissed her. The householder sat back up, and asked: “Venerable, what do you need?” She answered: “I want to have a wild jujube.”<note> See Mi Bi Pj 5 for the simile of the jujube.</note>

<lzh>長者言：「欲得者明日當送。」時有守房小沙彌尼，見作如此事，諸尼食還已具向說之。比丘尼眾聞，中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責偷羅難陀比丘尼言：「云何汝與長者作如此事耶？」諸比丘尼白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊即以此因緣集比丘僧，以無數方便呵責偷羅難陀比丘尼：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何偷羅難陀！汝與長者作如此事？」爾時世尊以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此偷羅難陀比丘尼癡人！多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼染污心，共染污心男子，從腋已下膝已上身相觸，若捉摩、若牽、若推、若上摩、若下摩、若舉、若下、若捉、若捺，是比丘尼波羅夷，不共住。是身相觸也。」</lzh>
The householder said: “What you want, I’ll send tomorrow.” Then there was a small sāmaṇerī guarding the building. She saw that they did such a thing, and when the bhikkhunīs returned from the meal, she told them everything. When the bhikkhunī assembly heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked Thullanandā bhikkhunī: “Why did you do such a thing with the householder?” The bhikkhunīs told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized Thullanandā bhikkhunī in countless ways: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why, Thullanandā, did you do such a thing with the householder?” Then, when the World-honored One had criticized her in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “This Thullanandā bhikkhunī is a fool! She has all kinds of taints, and is the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī with a defiled mind and a man with a defiled mind have their bodies touch each other below the armpits and above the knees; if they grasp, pull, push, rub upwards and downwards, lift up, set down, hold, and press each other, that bhikkhunī is pārājika, and doesn’t live in community, because she’s “one with bodily contact”.’”
