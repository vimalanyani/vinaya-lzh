<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時偷羅難陀比丘尼與比丘尼貿衣，後㥲恚還奪取：「妹！還我衣來，我不與汝。汝衣屬汝，我衣屬我。汝自取汝衣，我自取我衣。」</lzh>
Then Thullanandā bhikkhunī exchanged a robe with another bhikkhunī, and later she snatched it back out of anger (and said:) “Younger sister, return my robe, I didn’t give it to you. Your robe belongs to you, my robe belongs to me. Take your robe, and I’ll take my robe.”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責偷羅難陀比丘尼：「汝云何與比丘尼貿衣，後㥲恚還自奪取：『妹！還我衣來，我不與汝。汝衣屬汝，我衣屬我。汝自取汝衣，我自取我衣。』」時諸比丘尼往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊爾時以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責偷羅難陀比丘尼：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何偷羅難陀比丘尼！與比丘尼貿衣，後㥲恚還奪耶？」以無數方便呵責偷羅難陀比丘尼已，告諸比丘：「此偷羅難陀多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，與比丘尼貿易衣，後㥲恚還自奪取、若使人奪：『妹！還我衣來，我不與汝。汝衣屬汝，我衣還我。』者，尼薩耆波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked Thullanandā bhikkhunī: “Why did you exchange a robe with another bhikkhunī, and later snatch it back out of anger (and say:) ‘Younger sister, return my robe, I didn’t give it to you. Your robe belongs to you, my robe belongs to me. Take your robe, and I’ll take my robe.’?” The bhikkhunīs went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized Thullanandā bhikkhunī: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why, Thullanandā bhikkhunī, did you exchange a robe with another bhikkhunī, and later snatch it back out of anger?” Then, when he had criticized Thullanandā bhikkhunī in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “This Thullanandā has all kinds of taints, and is the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī exchanges a robe with another bhikkhunī, and later out of anger either snatches it back herself or has someone else snatch it back, (and says:) “Younger sister, return my robe, I didn’t give it to you. Your robe belongs to you, return my robe to me,” it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>衣者，十種衣如上。</lzh>
“A robe” means the 10 kinds of cloths, as above.

<lzh>貿易者，或以衣貿衣、或以衣貿非衣、或以非衣貿衣、若以非衣貿非衣、若鍼若刀、若縷、若碎段物乃至一丸藥。</lzh>
“Exchanging” means exchanging a robe for a robe, or exchanging a robe for something other than a robe, or exchanging something other than a robe for a robe, or exchanging something other than a robe for something other than a robe, whether a needle, a knife, thread, or broken items, down to one pill of medicine.

<lzh>彼比丘尼，與比丘尼貿衣，後㥲恚，自奪、若教人奪、藏者，尼薩耆波逸提。奪而不藏者，突吉羅。若彼得衣者，舉樹上、牆上、籬上、若橛上、象牙杙上、衣架上、若繩床上、木床上、大小褥上、若地敷上，若取離處，尼薩耆。取而不離處，突吉羅。
此尼薩耆當捨與僧如上。捨已懺悔如上。僧即應當還彼衣，白二羯磨還如上。若不還，受作五衣乃至數數著，一切突吉羅如上。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī exchanges a robe with another bhikkhunī, and later out of anger either snatches it back herself or instructs someone else to snatch it back, and hides it, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. If she snatches it but doesn’t hide it, it’s a dukkaṭa. If she obtains the robe and hangs it on a tree, on a wall, on a fence, on a pole, on a stake made of an elephant’s tusk, on a clothes rack, on a rope bed, on a wooden bed, on a big or small mat, if she lays it on the ground, or if she takes it and leaves that place, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. If she takes it but doesn’t leave that place, it’s a dukkaṭa. 
This nissaggiya should be relinquished to the sangha, as above. When she has relinquished it, she should confess as above. The sangha should then return the relinquished robe to her in a formal act with a motion as second to return it as above. If they don’t return it, if they accept it and make the five robes out of it, … or if they frequently wear it, in all cases it’s a dukkaṭa as above.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，和喻語：「妹！我悔，還我衣。」彼知有悔意還衣。若有餘比丘尼語言：「此比丘尼欲悔，汝還衣。」或彼借著無道理故還取，若豫知當失、若恐壞；若彼人破戒、若破見、若破威儀、若被舉、若滅擯、若應滅擯、若為此事命難、梵行難奪而不藏者，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she gently makes her aware: “Younger sister, I’ve remorse, return my robe,” if the other knows that she has thoughts of remorse and returns the robe, if there’s another bhikkhunī who says: “This bhikkhunī has desire and remorse. Return the robe,” if the other has borrowed and worn it illegitimately and she therefore takes it back, if she knows in advance that it’ll be lost, if she fears that it’ll be destroyed, if the other person breaks the precepts, breaks right view, breaks proper conduct, if she has been suspended, has been permanently expelled, or should be permanently expelled, if (the first bhikkhunī’s) life is in danger because of this matter, or if her celibacy is in danger, and she snatches it but doesn’t hide it, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 28th rule.)
