<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在羅閱祇耆闍崛山中。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Rājagaha on Vulture’s peak.

<lzh>時國人俗節會日伎樂嬉戲，時六群比丘尼往看。時諸居士見皆共譏嫌：「此諸比丘尼不知慚愧習不淨行，外自稱言：『我知正法。』如是有何正法？乃共看此種種戲事，與婬女賊女何異？」</lzh>
Then the citizens played music and enjoyed entertainments on a worldly holiday. The group-of-six bhikkhunīs went there to watch. When the householders saw them, they were all upset: “These bhikkhunīs know no shame and they engage in impure practices. Outwardly, they praise themselves: ‘We know the true dhamma’, how is that the true dhamma? Then they watch these various entertainments together. What’s the difference to prostitutes and criminals?” 

<lzh>諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責六群比丘尼：「云何汝等共看戲事？」時諸比丘尼往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊爾時以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責六群比丘尼：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何汝等共看戲事？」時世尊以無數方便呵責六群比丘尼已，告諸比丘：「此六群比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼往觀看伎樂者，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “Why did you watch entertainments together?” Then the bhikkhunīs went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you watch entertainments together?” Then, when the World-honored One had criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These group-of-six bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī goes to watch a musical performance, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>觀看者，看種種戲笑。</lzh>
“Watching” means seeing all kinds of entertainments.

<lzh>彼比丘尼，若從道至道、從道至非道、從非道至道、從高至下、從下至高，往看伎樂。若見波逸提。不見，突吉羅。若發意欲去而不去，若期去中道還，盡突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī goes to watch a musical performance, whether by going from a road to another road, or by leaving a road and going off-road, or by going from off-road to a road, or by going down from above, or by going up from below, and if she sees it, it’s a pācittiya. If she doesn’t see it, it’s a dukkaṭa. If she gives rise to the intention and the wish to go, but doesn’t go, or if she sets a time to go, but turns back on the way, all are dukkaṭas.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，或有所啟，若被喚道由邊過，或彼宿止處，或為強力將去、或縛去、或命難、或梵行難，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if there’s something to report, if she’s summoned and the road passes by there, if it’s in her residence, if she’s made to go by force, if she’s arrested and made to go, if her life is in danger, or if her celibacy is in danger, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 79th rule.)
