<h2>First Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>爾時六群比丘尼乞酥而食。時諸居士見皆共譏嫌言：「此比丘尼，不知慚愧乞求無厭，外自稱言：『我知正法。』如是有何正法？乞酥而食，如賊女婬女無異。」</lzh>
Then the group-of-six bhikkhunīs asked for ghee and ate it. When the householders saw it, they were all upset and said: “These bhikkhunīs know no shame. They ask without limit. Outwardly, they praise themselves: ‘We know the true dhamma’, how is that the true dhamma? They ask for ghee and eat it, there’s no difference to criminals and prostitutes.”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，呵責六群比丘尼言：「汝云何乞酥而食耶？」呵責已即白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責六群比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何比丘尼乞酥而食耶？」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼乞酥而食，犯應懺可呵法，應向餘比丘尼說言：『大姊！我犯可呵法所不應為，今向大姊悔過。』是法名悔過法。」如是世尊與比丘尼結戒。</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “Why did you ask for ghee and eat it?” Having criticized them, they then told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why, bhikkhunīs, did you ask for ghee and eat it?” When he had criticized them in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Preliminary Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī asks for ghee and eats it, she commits an offense that should be confessed and criticized. She should say to another bhikkhunī: “Venerable sister, I’ve committed an offense to be criticized, that shouldn’t be done. I now confess it to the venerable sister.” This is called an offense to be confessed.’ In this way the World-honored One laid down the precept for the bhikkhunīs.


<h2>Second Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>彼有疑，不敢為病者乞，自身病亦不敢乞，他為乞復不敢食。佛言：「自今已去聽自病乞、為病者乞、他為乞得食。自今已去當如是結戒：若比丘尼，不病乞酥食者，犯應懺悔可呵法，應向餘比丘尼說言：『大姊！我犯可呵法所不應為，我今向大姊懺悔。』是名悔過法。」</lzh>
Another (bhikkhunī) had doubts and didn’t dare to ask for someone who was sick, she didn’t dare to ask when she herself was sick, and when others asked for her, she also didn’t dare to eat it. The Buddha said: “From now on, I allow to ask when oneself is sick, to ask for another who is sick, and to eat what others have asked for and obtained. From now on, you should recite the precept like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī who isn’t sick asks for ghee and eats it, she commits an offense that should be confessed and criticized. She should say to another bhikkhunī: “Venerable sister, I’ve committed an offense to be criticized, that shouldn’t be done. I now confess it to the venerable sister.” This is called an offense to be confessed.’


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼，無病而乞酥食，一咽一波羅提提舍尼。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī who isn’t sick asks for ghee and eats it, each mouthful is a pātidesanīya.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，為己病乞、為病者乞、或為他他為己、或不乞而自得，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she asks when she’s sick, if she asks for someone who is sick, if she asks for others, if others ask for her, or if she obtains it without asking, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。(一)</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (The first rule.)

<lzh>乞油，若蜜、若黑石蜜、若乳、若酪、若魚、若肉，如乞酥無異。</lzh>
Asking for oil, honey, black sugar, milk, curds, fish, or meat is the same as asking for ghee.

<lzh>(上四戒，比丘、式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。下四戒，比丘，波逸提；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。下眾學戒與大僧戒無異，故不出耳)</lzh>
The first four precepts are dukkaṭas for a bhikkhu, a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī. The last four are pācittiyas for a bhikkhu.<note> Pāli bhikkhu pācittiya 39 covers all of these 8 foods and also adds butter, and assigns a pācittiya for all of them. However, the Dharmaguptaka bhikkhu parallel, pācittiya 40, only covers milk, curds, fish, and meat.</note> For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, they’re dukkaṭas. The following many training precepts (sekhiyas) are the same as the bhikkhu precepts, therefore they’re not repeated.
