<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時偷羅難陀比丘尼作如是念：「著䘢髁衣令身麁大。」居士見皆共譏嫌：「此比丘尼等，不知慚愧犯梵行，外自稱言：『我知正法。』如是有何正法？云何著䘢髁衣令身麁大，如似婬女賊女無異？」</lzh>
Then Thullanandā bhikkhunī thought: “Wearing a padded waist-cloth makes the body more bulky.” When the householders saw this, they were all upset: “This bhikkhunī knows no shame, she has broken celibacy. Outwardly, she praises herself: ‘I know the true dhamma’, how is that the true dhamma? Why does she wear a padded waist-cloth to make her body more bulky? There’s no difference to prostitutes and criminals.”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，呵責偷羅難陀言：「汝云何作如是念：『著䘢髁衣令身麁大。』耶？」即白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責偷羅難陀言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何比丘尼，作如是心：『著䘢髁衣令身麁大。』」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼著䘢髁衣者，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They criticized Thullanandā: “Why did you think: ‘Wearing a padded waist-cloth makes the body more bulky.’?” Then they told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha and criticized Thullanandā: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why, bhikkhunī, did you think: ‘Wearing a padded waist-cloth makes the body more bulky.’?” When he had criticized her in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “This bhikkhunī has all kinds of taints, and is the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī wears a padded waist-cloth, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>䘢髁衣者，若用毳、若劫貝、若俱遮羅、若乳葉草、若芻摩、若野蠶綿一切物，</lzh>
“A padded waist-cloth” means using various things like down, cotton, kusa grass, leaves and grass with milky (sap), linen, or wild silk.

<lzh>比丘尼作如是意：「著䘢髁衣令身麁大。」波逸提。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī thinks: “Wearing a padded waist-cloth makes the body more bulky,” it’s a pācittiya.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，或有如是病，內著病衣；外著涅槃僧，次著袈裟；或為強力者所執，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she has a certain illness and wears the menstrual robe underneath, the lower robe on top, and then the upper robe, or if she’s held by force, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 156th rule.)
