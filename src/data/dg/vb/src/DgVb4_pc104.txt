<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在毘舍離獼猴江側高閣講堂上。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Vesālī, in the hall with the peaked roof near the monkey pond. 

<lzh>時眾僧多得供養。時有比丘尼，置僧伽梨在房，不看曬治虫爛色壞。後時眾僧供養斷，此比丘尼，不看僧伽梨至村邊著，欲入村方見僧伽梨虫爛色壞。</lzh>
Then the sangha received many offerings. There was a bhikkhunī who placed a saṅghāṭī in a building and didn’t look after, sun, or take care of it. Insects spoiled it and the color faded. At a later time, the offerings to the sangha stopped. This bhikkhunī, without looking at the saṅghāṭī, approached the village and put it on. When she wanted to enter the village, she saw that the saṅghāṭī had been spoiled by insects and that the color had faded.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，呵責此比丘尼言：「云何置僧伽梨在房，不看曬治使虫爛色壞？」時諸比丘尼往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責此比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何置僧伽梨在房，不看曬治虫爛色壞？」時世尊以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼過五日不看僧伽梨，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They criticized this bhikkhunī: “Why did you place a saṅghāṭī in a building and didn’t look after, sun, and take care of it, which caused it to be spoiled by insects and made the color fade?” Then the bhikkhunīs went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized this bhikkhunī: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you place a saṅghāṭī in a building and didn’t look after, sun, and take care of it? It was spoiled by insects and the color faded.” Then, when the World-honored One had criticized her in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “This bhikkhunī has all kinds of taints, and is the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī doesn’t look after her saṅghāṭī for more than five days, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼，置僧伽梨在房中，五日、五日應往看。不看波逸提。除僧伽梨，餘衣不五日、五日看，突吉羅。除餘衣，若不五日、五日看餘所須之物，令失者虫爛色壞，突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī places a saṅghāṭī in a building, she should go there and look after it every five days. If she doesn’t look after it, it it a pācittiya. If she doesn’t look after robes other than the saṅghāṭī every five days, it’s a dukkaṭa. If she doesn’t look after necessary items other than the robes every five days, which causes them to be lost, to be spoiled by insects, and their color to fade, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，置僧伽梨在房，五日、五日看；若舉處堅牢；若寄人，彼受寄人言：「但安意，我當為汝看。」彼若看恐失，不五日、五日看，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she places a saṅghāṭī in a building and looks after it every five days, if she secures it in an elevated place, or if she entrusts it to someone and the person receiving it says: “Just be at peace, I’ll look after it for you,” and they look after it and worry that it might be lost, and (the bhikkhunī) doesn’t look after it every five days, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 104th rule.)
