<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時世尊在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。時偷羅難陀比丘尼妹，字坻舍難陀，其人犯波羅夷法。時偷羅難陀比丘尼知，便作是念：「此坻舍難陀是我妹！今犯波羅夷法，我正欲向人說，懼彼得惡名稱。若彼得惡名稱，於我亦惡。」遂默然不說。彼於異時，坻舍比丘尼休道。諸比丘尼見，語偷羅難陀言：「見汝妹已捨道不？」答言：「彼所作是，非為不是。」諸比丘尼問：「云何所作是？」偷羅難陀答言：「我先知彼有如是如是事。」諸比丘尼言：「汝若先知，何以不向諸比丘尼說？」偷羅難陀答言：「坻舍是我妹！犯波羅夷法即欲向人說，懼得惡名稱。若彼得惡名稱，於我亦惡。以是故我不向人說。」</lzh>
At that time, the World-honored One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park. Then Thullanandā bhikkhunī’s younger sister called Tissanandā committed a pārājika offense. When Thullanandā bhikkhunī found out, she thought: “Tissanandā is my younger sister. Now she has committed a pārājika offense. I rightly want to tell others, but I fear that she’ll get a bad reputation. If she gets a bad reputation, it’ll also be bad for me.” Thus she remained silent, and didn’t tell anyone. At a later time, Tissā bhikkhunī disrobed. When the bhikkhunīs saw this, they said to Thullanandā: “Did you see that your younger sister has disrobed?” She answered: “She did what was to be done, not what wasn’t to be done.” The bhikkhunīs asked: “Why was it to be done?” Thullanandā answered: “I previously already knew that she did such-and-such a thing.” The bhikkhunīs said: “If you previously knew, why did you not tell us?” Thullanandā answered: “Tissā is my younger sister. When she committed the pārājika offense, I wanted to tell people, but I feared that she’d get a bad reputation. If she got a bad reputation, it’d also have been bad for me. Therefore, I didn’t tell others.”

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，呵責偷羅難陀言：「汝云何覆藏坻舍重罪？」諸比丘尼白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊爾時以此因緣集諸比丘僧，呵責偷羅難陀比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何偷羅難陀！汝乃覆藏坻舍比丘尼重罪？」爾時世尊以無數方便，呵責偷羅難陀比丘尼已，告諸比丘：「偷羅難陀比丘尼！多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，知他犯波羅夷，不自舉、不白僧、不語人。彼於異時，彼比丘尼，或休道、若滅擯、若眾僧遮、若入外道。後作是言：『我先知有如是如是罪。』是比丘尼波羅夷，不共住，覆重罪故。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They criticized Thullanandā bhikkhunī: “Why did you cover up Tissā’s grave offense?” Then the bhikkhunīs told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized Thullanandā: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why, Thullanandā bhikkhunī, did you cover up Tissā bhikkhunī’s grave offense?” Then, when the World-honored One had criticized Thullanandā bhikkhunī in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “Thullanandā bhikkhunī has all kinds of taints, and is the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: ‘If a bhikkhunī knows that another (bhikkhunī) has committed a pārājika, and neither charges her herself, nor informs the sangha, nor tells others, but if at a later time after that bhikkhunī has either disrobed, or been permanently expelled, or been barred by the sangha, or has joined a non-Buddhist group, she should say: “I previously already knew that she had committed such-and-such an offense,” that bhikkhunī is pārājika, and doesn’t live in community, because she concealed a grave offense.’”

<lzh>如是世尊與比丘尼制戒。或於城內犯波羅夷，出至村中；或村中犯波羅夷，來入城內。時諸比丘尼，亦不知犯波羅夷不犯，後乃知犯波羅夷；或有言犯波羅夷者，或有疑者。佛言：「不知者無犯。自今已去當如是說戒：若比丘尼，知比丘尼犯波羅夷，不自發露、不語眾人、不白大眾。若於異時，彼比丘尼，或命終、或眾中舉、或休道、或入外道眾，後作是言：『我先知有如是如是罪。』是比丘尼波羅夷，不共住，覆藏重罪故。」</lzh>
In this way, the World-honored One laid down the precept for the bhikkhunīs. Some commited a pārājika in a city and went to a village, some committed a pārājika in a village and came to the city. Then the bhikkhunīs didn’t know if they had committed a pārājika or not, and they only found out later that they had committed a pārājika. Some said that they had committed a pārājika. Some had doubts. The Buddha said: “If you don’t know, there’s no offense. From now on, you should recite the precept like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī knows that another bhikkhunī has committed a pārājika, and neither discloses it herself, nor tells members of the assembly, nor informs the great assembly, but if at a later time after that bhikkhunī has either passed away, or been charged in the midst of the assembly, or disrobed, or joined a non-Buddhist group, she should say: “I previously already knew that she had such-and-such an offense,” that bhikkhunī is pārājika, and doesn’t live in community, because she concealed a grave offense.’” 


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>知者，我知犯如是如是罪。</lzh>
“Knowing” means “I know that she has committed such-and-such an offense.”

<lzh>僧者，一羯磨、一說戒。</lzh>
“Sangha” means those who are united in formal acts, and united in the precept recitation. 

<lzh>大眾者，或四人或過四人。</lzh>
“The great assembly” means four persons or more.

<lzh>休道者，出此法外。</lzh>
“Disrobing” means leaving this dhamma.

<lzh>滅擯者，僧與作白四羯磨除去。</lzh>
“Permanently expelling” means that the sangha carries out a formal act with a motion as fourth, and sends her away.

<lzh>遮者，眾中斷決罪時遮不聽入眾。</lzh>
“Barring” means that when the sangha deliberates about the offense, they bar her and don’t allow her to enter the assembly.

<lzh>入外道者，受外道法。</lzh>
“Joining non-Buddhists” means accepting non-Buddhist doctrines.

<lzh>重罪者，八波羅夷，於八法中犯一一罪。</lzh>
“A grave offense” means the eight pārājikas; committing any offense among these eight rules.

<lzh>彼比丘尼，知是比丘尼犯波羅夷，前食時知、後食時說，偷蘭遮。後食時知、初夜說，偷蘭遮。初夜知、中夜說，偷蘭遮。中夜知、後夜說，偷蘭遮。後夜知、不說至明相出，波羅夷。除八波羅夷法，覆餘罪不說者，隨所犯自覆重罪，偷蘭遮。除比丘、比丘尼，覆餘人罪，突吉羅。</lzh>
If that bhikkhunī, who knows that another bhikkhunī has committed a pārājika, learns about it before the meal time, and tells about it after the meal time, it’s a thullaccaya. If she learns about it after the meal time, and tells about it at the beginning of the night, it’s a thullaccaya. If she learns about it at the beginning of the night, and tells about it in the middle of the night, it’s a thullaccaya. If she learns about it in the middle of the night, and tells about it at the end of the night, it’s a thullaccaya. If she learns about it at the end of the night, and hasn’t told about it at dawn, it’s a pārājika. If she hides another offense except for the eight pārājika rules, and doesn’t tell about it, it’s (to be dealt with) according to what has been committed. If she hides her own grave offense, it’s a thullaccaya. Except for bhikkhus and bhikkhunīs, if she hides other people’s offenses, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，波逸提；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a pācittiya. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，若不知、若向人說、若無人可向說、意欲說而未說明相出；若說者，有命難、有梵行難，不得說不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she doesn’t know, if she tells others, if there’s nobody whom she could tell, if she intends to tell but hasn’t told it yet at dawn, and if, when she tells it, her life is in danger or her celibacy is in danger, she needn’t tell and the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。(七竟)</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the seventh rule.)
