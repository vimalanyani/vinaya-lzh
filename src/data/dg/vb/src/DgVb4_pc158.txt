<h2>First Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時六群比丘尼著革屣手擎蓋而行，諸居士見皆共譏嫌：「此比丘尼，不知慚愧犯梵行，外自稱言：『我知正法。』如是有何正法？著革屣擎蓋而行，如似婬女賊女無異。」</lzh>
Then the group-of-six bhikkhunīs walked around wearing leather sandals and holding umbrellas in their hands. When the householders saw this, they were all upset: “These bhikkhunīs know no shame, they’ve broken celibacy. Outwardly, they praise themselves: ‘We know the true dhamma’, how is that the true dhamma? They walk around wearing leather sandals and holding umbrellas. There’s no difference to prostitutes and criminals.”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，呵責六群比丘尼言：「汝云何乃著革屣手擎蓋而行？」即白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責六群比丘尼：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何著革屣手擎蓋而行？」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼著革屣持蓋在道行者，波逸提。」如是世尊與比丘尼結戒。</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “Why did you walk around wearing leather sandals and holding umbrellas in your hands?” Then they told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you walk around wearing leather sandals and holding umbrellas in your hands?” When he had criticized them in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Preliminary Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī walks on a road wearing leather sandals and holding an umbrella, it’s a pācittiya.’” In this way the World-honored One laid down the precept for the bhikkhunīs.


<h2>Second Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>時諸比丘尼，至小食大食處，若夜集若說戒時，行遇雨漬壞新染色衣。佛言：「自今已去聽護身、護衣、護臥具故，在僧伽藍內作樹皮蓋、葉蓋、竹蓋。」</lzh>
Then when the bhikkhunīs went to the dining place, to a gathering at night, or to recite the precepts, they encountered rain while walking, and it soaked and destroyed the color of newly-dyed robes. The Buddha said: “From now on, I allow to make umbrellas from tree bark, leaves, or bamboo inside the monastery, to protect the body, the robes, and the bedding.”


<h2>Third Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>時有比丘尼天雨時塗跣行泥，污脚污衣污坐具。佛言：「自今已去聽為護身、護衣、護坐具故，在僧伽藍中作屧著。」</lzh>
Then there was a bhikkhunī who dirtied her bare feet while walking in the mud when it was raining. She soiled her feet, her robes, and the sitting mat. The Buddha said: “From now on, I allow to make and wear sandals inside the monastery, to protect the body, the robes, and the sitting mat.”


<h2>Fourth Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>諸比丘尼雖作屧，猶污衣污身污坐具。佛言：「自今已去聽下著樹皮、若皮墮，以縷綖綴、若斷，聽用筋若毛，或用皮帶繫之。自今已去當如是說戒：若比丘尼著革屣持蓋行，除時因緣，波逸提。」</lzh>
Although the bhikkhunīs made sandals, they still soiled their robes, their bodies, and the sitting mats. The Buddha said: “From now on, I allow to attach tree bark underneath. If the bark falls off, to sew it with thread. If (the thread) breaks, I allow to use sinews or hair, or to use strips of leather to tie it. From now on, you should recite the precept like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī walks around wearing leather sandals and holding an umbrella, except at a suitable time for a good reason, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼，著革屣持蓋行，除時因緣波逸提。彼比丘尼，著革屣持蓋行，隨所行村界，一一波逸提。無村阿蘭若處，隨行十里，一波逸提。行減一村界，突吉羅。減十里，突吉羅。行一界內，突吉羅。方便欲去而不去，若共期去而不去，一切突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī walks around wearing leather sandals and holding an umbrella, except at a suitable time for a good reason, it’s a pācittiya. If a bhikkhunī walks around wearing leather sandals and holding an umbrella, whenever she reaches the territory of a village, each village is a pācittiya. Whenever she walks 10 leagues in the wilderness where there’s no village, it’s a pācittiya. If she walks less than the distance of a village territory, it’s a dukkaṭa. If she walks less than 10 leagues, it’s a dukkaṭa. If she walks within a territory, it’s a dukkaṭa. If she plans and wants to go but doesn’t go, or if she makes an appointment to go but doesn’t go, in all cases it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，或時有如是病，若護身護衣護臥具，於僧伽藍中作樹皮蓋、葉蓋、竹蓋；護身、護衣、護臥具故，於僧伽藍內作屧著，不犯。或為強力者所執，或為繫閉，或命難、梵行難，著革屣持蓋行者，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she has a certain illness at that time, if she makes an umbrella from tree bark, leaves, or bamboo inside the monastery to protect her body, robes, and bedding, or if she makes and wears sandals inside the monastery to protect her body, robes, and bedding, the offense isn’t committed.
If she’s held by force, if she’s imprisoned, if her life is in danger, or if her celibacy is in danger, and she walks around wearing leather sandals and holding an umbrella, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 158th rule.)
