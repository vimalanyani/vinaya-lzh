<h2>First Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時安隱比丘尼大智慧問諸比丘義，彼諸比丘被問已不能答皆慚愧。</lzh>
Then Khemā bhikkhunī, who was very wise, asked the bhikkhus about the meaning of something. When the bhikkhus had been asked by her, they were unable to answer and were all ashamed.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責安隱比丘尼言：「汝云何有大智慧而問諸比丘義使不能答令慚愧耶？」即白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責安隱比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何有大智慧而問諸比丘義令諸比丘不能答有慚愧耶？」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼問比丘義者，波逸提。」如是世尊與比丘尼結戒。</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked Khemā bhikkhunī: “Why did you, who are very wise, ask the bhikkhus about the meaning of something? They were unable to answer and it made them ashamed.” Then they told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha and criticized Khemā bhikkhunī: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you, who are very wise, ask the bhikkhus about the meaning of something? The bhikkhus were unable to answer and it made them ashamed.” When he had criticized her in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “This bhikkhunī has all kinds of taints, and is the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Preliminary Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī asks a bhikkhu about the meaning of something, it’s a pācittiya.’” In this way the World-honored One laid down the precept for the bhikkhunīs.


<h2>Second Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>時諸比丘尼，教授日不知從誰求教授，有疑不知當何從問義。佛言：「自今已去若欲問義者，當先求聽已然後問。自今已去當如是結戒：若比丘尼欲問比丘義，先不求而問者，波逸提。」</lzh>
Then the bhikkhunīs didn’t know whom to ask for instruction on the instruction day. They had doubts and didn’t know how they should ask about the meaning of something. The Budda said: “From now on, if you want to ask about the meaning of something, you should first request permission and afterwards ask him. From now on, you should recite the precept like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī wants to ask a bhikkhu about the meaning of something, and asks without first requesting (permission), it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼問比丘義，先不求而問，說而了了者，波逸提；不了了者，突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī asks a bhikkhu about the meaning of something, and asks without first requesting (permission), if she speaks and others understand, it’s a pācittiya. If others don’t understand, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，先求而後問，若先常聽問，若先是親厚，若親厚者語言：「汝但問，我當為汝求請。」若彼從此受，若二人俱從他受，若彼問此答，二人共誦，或戲笑語、或疾疾語、或屏處語、或夢中語、或欲說此乃錯說彼，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she first requests (permission) and later asks, if he has previously always allowed to ask, if previously they were friends, if his friend says: “Just ask, I’ll request an invitation for you,” if he receives (the dhamma) from her, if two persons together receive it from another, if he asks and she answers, if two persons recite together, if she says it jokingly, if she speaks quickly, if she speaks in a secluded place, if she speaks in a dream, or if she wants to say one thing but by mistake says something else, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 172nd rule.)
