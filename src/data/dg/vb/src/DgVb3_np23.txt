<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時眾多比丘尼為作房舍故人間乞求，處處乞索多得財物。諸比丘尼即自念言：「若我以此物作屋者多諸事故，比丘尼衣服難得應辦五衣，我等今寧可以此物用貿衣共分。」念已貿衣共分。後於異時，諸居士問言：「前與物作舍者竟作舍不？」答言：「不作。」問言：「何以故不作？」答言：「我等自念：『設作屋者多諸事故，比丘尼衣服難得應具五衣。我等寧可以此物貿衣共分。』念已即貿衣共分。」時諸居士聞已皆共譏嫌言：「此諸比丘尼受取無厭，外自稱言：『我知正法。』如是何有正法？以我等舍直貿衣共分。我等豈不知比丘尼衣服難得應具五衣耶？但我等聞世尊所說：『最第一福者，作房施四方僧。』」</lzh>
Then a group of bhikkhunīs asked among the people in order to build a building. They asked here and there and received many goods. Then the bhikkhunīs thought to themselves: “If we build a building with these things, there will be many duties. For bhikkhunīs, robes are hard to get, and we should prepare our five robes. We’d better now use these things to exchange them for robes, and distribute them.” When they had thought this, they exchanged them for robes, and distributed them. At a later time, the householders asked: “With the things we previously gave for building an abode, have you finished building the abode?” They answered: “We didn’t build it.” They asked: “Why didn’t you build it?” They answered: “We thought to ourselves: ‘If we arrange to build a building, there will be many duties. For bhikkhunīs, robes are hard to get, and we should have five robes complete. We’d better exchange these things for robes, and distribute them.’ When we had thought this, we exchanged them for robes, and distributed them.” When the householders heard this, they were all upset and said: “These bhikkhunīs take without limit. Outwardly, they praise themselves: ‘We know the true dhamma’, how is that the true dhamma? They exchanged our funds for abodes for robes and distributed them, as if we don’t know that for bhikkhunīs robes are hard to get, and they should have five robes complete? But we heard the World-honored One say: ‘The highest merit is to build a building and offer it to the sangha of the four directions.’”

<lzh>是諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，呵責彼比丘尼：「汝等云何以他舍直貿衣共分？」諸比丘尼往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊爾時以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責諸比丘尼：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何比丘尼，檀越與舍直貿衣共分？」以無數方便呵責諸比丘尼已，告諸比丘：「彼諸比丘尼癡人！多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，檀越所為施物異，自求為僧迴作餘用，尼薩耆波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They criticized these bhikkhunīs: “Why did you exchange someone’s funds for abodes for robes and distribute them?” Then the bhikkhunīs went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized these bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why, bhikkhunīs, did you exchange funds that a supporter has given for an abode for robes and distribute them?” Then, when the World-honored One had criticized the bhikkhunīs in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “Those bhikkhunīs are fools! They’ve all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī, when a supporter has given an item for a certain purpose, and she has asked for it herself for the sangha, diverts it towards another use, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>所為施物異者，施與作僧房用作衣，施作衣用作僧房，若為餘處施乃餘處用。</lzh>
“Having given an item for a certain purpose” means using what was given for building a sangha building to make robes, or using what was given for making robes to build a sangha building, or using what was given for one purpose for another purpose.

<lzh>自求者，自處處乞求。</lzh>
“Having asked for it oneself” means asking oneself here and there.

<lzh>為僧者，僧物如上說。</lzh>
“For the sangha” means the sangha’s things as explained above.

<lzh>若比丘尼，所為施物異，自求為僧迴作餘用者，尼薩耆波逸提。此尼薩耆，應捨與僧如上法，捨已懺悔如上。僧即應還彼捨衣，作白二羯磨還如上。若不還，受作五衣乃至作非衣，數數著，一切突吉羅如上。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī, when an item has been given for a certain purpose, and she has asked for it herself for the sangha, diverts it towards another use, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. This nissaggiya should be relinquished to the sangha, as in the rule above. When she has relinquished it, she should confess as above. The sangha should then return the relinquished robe to her and carry out a formal act with a motion as second to return them as above. If they don’t return them, if they accept them and make the five robes out of them, … if they turn them into something other than a robe, or if they frequently wear them, in all cases it’s a dukkaṭa as above.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，若問物主隨物主處分用，若與物時語言：「隨意用。」若是親厚者語言：「隨意用。」我當語主，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she asks the donor of the item and uses it according to their intentions, if when they give it, they say: Use it as you like,” or if their friend says: “Use it as you like, I’ll speak with the donor,” the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 23rd rule.)
