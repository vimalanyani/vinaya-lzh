<h2>First Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時舍衛城中有一多知識比丘尼命過。復有比丘尼，於比丘所住寺中為起塔，諸比丘尼數來詣寺住立言語戲笑、或唄或悲哭者、或自莊嚴身者，遂亂諸坐禪比丘。時有長老迦毘羅常樂坐禪。比丘尼去後，即日往壞其塔除棄著僧伽藍外。時彼比丘尼，聞迦毘羅壞其塔除棄，皆執刀杖瓦石來欲打擲，時迦毘羅即以神足飛在虛空。</lzh>
Then, a very knowledgeable bhikkhunī passed away in Sāvatthī. Other bhikkhunīs built a stupa in a monastery where bhikkhus were staying. The bhikkhunīs often came to the monastery to stand around, to talk and to amuse themselves. Some chanted and some mourned and cried, and some adorned their bodies, and they consequently distracted the bhikkhus sitting in meditation. Then there was the venerable Kapila, who often enjoyed sitting in meditation. After the bhikkhunīs had gone, on the same day, he went and destroyed their stupa, and threw it away outside the monastery. When the bhikkhunīs heard that Kapila had destroyed their stupa and thrown it away, they all took knives, staves, clods of earth, and stones, and came, wanting to beat him. Then Kapila flew up into the sky by psychic powers.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，呵責諸比丘尼：「汝云何乃欲持刀杖瓦石打迦毘羅耶？」即白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以是因緣集比丘僧，呵責諸比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何乃持刀杖瓦石欲打比丘？」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，入比丘僧伽藍中，波逸提。」如是世尊與比丘尼結戒。</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They criticized these bhikkhunīs: “Why did you want to beat Kapila with knives, staves, clods of earth, and stones?” Then they told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha and criticized these bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you take knives, staves, clods of earth, and stones, and wanted to beat a bhikkhu?” When he had criticized them in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>First Preliminary Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī enters a bhikkhu monastery, it’s a pācittiya.’” In this way the World-honored One laid down the precept for the bhikkhunīs.


<h2>Second Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>諸比丘尼疑，不敢入無比丘僧伽藍中。佛言：「聽入。自今已去應如是結戒：若比丘尼，入有比丘僧伽藍中，波逸提。」如是世尊與比丘尼結戒。</lzh>
Then the bhikkhunīs had doubts and didn’t dare to enter a monastery where no bhikkhus were. The Buddha said: “I allow to enter. From now on, you should recite the precept like this: 


<h2>Second Preliminary Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī enters a monastery where there are bhikkhus, it’s a pācittiya.’” In this way the World-honored One laid down the precept for the bhikkhunīs.


<h2>Third Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>時諸比丘尼，亦不知有比丘無比丘，後方知有比丘，或有作波逸提懺者、或疑者。「不知者無犯。」佛言：「自今已去當如是結戒：若比丘尼，知有比丘寺入者，波逸提。」如是世尊與比丘尼結戒。</lzh>
Then the bhikkhunīs also didn’t know if there were bhikkhus or not, and they only found out later that there were bhikkhus. Some confessed a pācittiya. Some had doubts. (The Buddha said:) “If you don’t know, there’s no offense.” The Buddha said: “From now on, you should recite the precept like this: 


<h2>Third Preliminary Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī knows that there are bhikkhus in the monastery and enters, it’s a pācittiya.’” In this way the World-honored One laid down the precept for the bhikkhunīs.


<h2>Fourth Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>彼欲求教授，不知何從求？有疑欲問，不知從誰問？不敢入寺。佛言：「自今已去聽白然後入寺。」彼欲禮佛塔、聲聞塔，佛言：「欲禮佛塔、聲聞塔，聽輒入，餘者須白已入。自今已去當如是說戒：若比丘尼，知有比丘僧伽藍，不白而入者，波逸提。」</lzh>
They wanted to ask for instruction, but they didn’t know whom to ask. They had doubts and wanted to ask someone about them, but didn’t know whom to ask. They didn’t dare to enter a monastery. The Buddha said: “From now on, I allow to inform them and afterwards enter the monastery.” They wanted to pay respect to a stupa of the Buddha or a stupa of a disciple. The Buddha said: “If you want to pay respect to a stupa of the Buddha or a stupa of a disciple, I allow to just enter. At other times, you need to inform them and then enter. From now on, you should recite the precept like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī knows that there are bhikkhus in a monastery and enters without informing them, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>若比丘尼，知有比丘僧伽藍，不白而入門，波逸提。一脚在門內、一脚在門外方便欲入，若期入而不入者，一切突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī knows that there are bhikkhus in a monastery and enters without informing them, it’s a pācittiya. If she has one foot inside the gate and one foot outside, if she plans and wishes to enter, or if she sets a time to enter, but doesn’t enter, all cases are dukkaṭas.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，若先不知，若無比丘而入；若禮拜佛塔、聲聞塔，餘者白已入；若來受教授、若欲問法來入、若被請、若道由中過、或在中止宿、或為強力者所將去、或被繫閉將去、或命難、梵行難，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she doesn’t know at first, if there are no bhikkhus and she enters, if she pays respect at a stupa of the Buddha or of a disciple, if at other times, she enters after informing them, if she comes to receive instruction, if she wants to ask about dhamma and enters, if she has been invited, if the road passes through there, if her residence is inside, if she’s made to go by force, if she’s imprisoned and made to go, if her life is in danger, or her celibacy is in danger, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 144th rule.)
