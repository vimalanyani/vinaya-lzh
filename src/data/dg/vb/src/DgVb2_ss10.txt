<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時佛在羅閱城耆闍崛山中。時世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，告諸比丘：「自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，欲壞和合僧，方便受破僧法，堅持不捨，是比丘尼應諫彼比丘尼言：『大姊！汝莫壞和合僧，莫方便壞和合僧，莫受破僧法，堅持不捨。大姊！應與僧和合，與僧和合歡喜不諍，同一師學如水乳合，於佛法中有增益安樂住。』是比丘尼諫彼比丘尼時，堅持不捨，是比丘尼應三諫，捨此事故。乃至三諫，捨者善；不捨者，是比丘尼犯三法應捨，僧伽婆尸沙。」(十竟)</lzh>
At that time, the Buddha was in Rājagaha on Vulture’s peak. Then the World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and said to the bhikkhus: “From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī wants to destroy the sangha in harmony, makes plans for a matter that can split the sangha, and holds firmly on to it without giving it up, the bhikkhunīs should admonish that bhikkhunī, saying: “Venerable sister, don’t destroy the sangha in harmony, don’t make plans to destroy the sangha in harmony, don’t accept a matter that can split the sangha, holding firmly on to it without giving it up. Venerable sister, you should be in harmony with the sangha. When you’re in harmony with the sangha, happy, and without quarreling, training under one teacher, mixing like water and milk, you’ll grow in the Buddha’s dhamma and live comfortably.” If when the bhikkhunīs admonish that bhikkhunī, she holds firmly on to it and doesn’t give it up, the bhikkhunīs should admonish her three times to give up this matter. If she gives it up by the third time, it’s fine. If not, that bhikkhunī commits an offense that should be given up after three admonishments, a saṅghādisesa.’” (End of the 10th rule.)
