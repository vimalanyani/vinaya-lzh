<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時比丘尼僧欲出迦絺那衣。時六群比丘尼作是意：「今比丘尼僧如法出迦絺那衣，遮使不出，欲令久得五事放捨。」諸比丘尼知六群比丘尼作如是意：「遮比丘尼僧如法出迦絺那衣，欲令五事久得放捨。」</lzh>
Then the bhikkhunī sangha wanted to remove the kaṭhina robe. The group-of-six bhikkhunīs thought: “Now the bhikkhunī sangha will remove the kaṭhina robe according to dhamma. We’ll obstruct it and not let them remove it. We want to obtain release from the five things for a long time.” The bhikkhunīs got to know that the group-of-six bhikkhunīs had thought: “We’ll obstruct the bhikkhunī sangha from removing the kaṭhina robe according to dhamma. We want to obtain release from the five things for a long time.”

<lzh>諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責六群比丘尼言：「云何作是意：『遮比丘尼僧如法出迦絺那衣，欲令五事久得放捨。』」往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白佛。佛以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責六群比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。比丘尼眾欲如法出迦絺那衣，云何遮令不出，欲令久得五事放捨耶？」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼作如是意：『遮比丘尼僧不出迦絺那衣，欲令久得五事放捨。』波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “Why did you think: ‘We’ll obstruct the bhikkhunī sangha from removing the kaṭhina robe according to dhamma. We want to obtain release from the five things for a long time.’?” They went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the Buddha. The Buddha for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha and criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. The bhikkhunī sangha wants to remove the kaṭhina robe acconding to dhamma. Why did you obstruct them and not let them remove it, and why did you want to obtain release from the five things for a long time?” When he had criticized them in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī thinks: “I’ll obstruct the bhikkhunī sangha from removing the kaṭhina robe. I want to obtain release from the five things for a long time,” it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>僧者，如上。</lzh>
“Sangha” is as above.

<lzh>法者，如法如律如佛所教。</lzh>
“Dhamma” means according to dhamma and vinaya, according to the Buddha’s teaching.

<lzh>彼比丘尼作是意：「遮比丘尼僧如法出迦絺那衣，欲令久得五事放捨。」說而了了者，波逸提；不了了者，突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī thinks: “I’ll obstruct the bhikkhunī sangha from removing the kaṭhina robe according to dhamma. I want to obtain release from the five things for a long time”, and if she speaks and others understand, it’s a pācittiya. If they don’t understand, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，出迦絺那衣非時，非法別眾、非法和合眾、法別眾、似法別眾、似法和合眾、非法非律非佛所教，若出恐失壞，如是遮者，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if they remove the kaṭhina robe out-of-season, if it’s done against the dhamma in a divided assembly, if it’s done against the dhamma in a harmonious assembly, if it’s done according to dhamma in a divided assembly, if it’s done with what resembles dhamma in a divided assembly, if it’s done with what resembles dhamma in a harmonious assembly, if it’s done against the dhamma and vinaya, against the Buddha’s teaching, or if when they remove it, she fears that it’ll be lost or destroyed, and she therefore obstructs it, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 110th rule.)
