<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時世尊在毘舍離，以此因緣集諸比丘僧，告諸比丘：「自今已去與諸比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，故自手斷人命、若持刀授與人，若歎死、譽死、勸死：『咄！人用此惡活為？寧死不生。』作如是心念，無數方便歎死、譽死、勸死，此比丘尼波羅夷，不共住。」(三竟)</lzh>
At that time, the World-honored One was in Vesālī.

<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī intentionally and with her own hand takes the life of a human being, or takes a knife and gives it to someone, or encourages, praises and recommends death, (saying): “Hey, what use is this bad life? Death is preferable, don’t live on”; if thinking like this, she with countless skillful means encourages, praises and recommends death, that bhikkhunī is pārājika, and doesn’t live in community.’” (End of the third rule.)
