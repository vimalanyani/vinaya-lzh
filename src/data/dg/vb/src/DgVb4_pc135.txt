<h2>First Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>諸比丘尼，聞世尊制戒得度人。時諸比丘尼，便度與童男男子相敬愛、愁憂喜瞋恚女人受具足戒。受具足戒已，彼以念男子故，愁憂瞋恚與比丘尼共鬪諍。</lzh>
Then the bhikkhunīs heard that the World-honored One had laid down a precept that one may ordain someone, and the bhikkhunīs then gave the full ordination to women who were in love with boys or men, and who were distressed, and liked getting angry. Having received the full ordination, because they were thinking of men, they were distressed and angry and quarreled with the other bhikkhunīs.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責諸比丘尼言：「世尊制戒聽度人，云何乃度與童男男子相敬愛、愁憂喜㥲恚者與授具足戒。受具足戒已，念彼男子故，愁憂㥲恚與比丘尼共鬪諍？」即白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責諸比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何度他與童男男子相敬愛、女人愁憂喜瞋恚者與授具足戒。受具足戒已，念彼男子故愁憂㥲恚，與比丘尼共鬪諍耶？」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此諸比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，度他與童男男子相敬愛、愁憂㥲恚女人受具足戒，波逸提。」如是世尊與比丘尼結戒。</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked these bhikkhunīs: “When the World-honored One had laid down a precept and allowed to ordain people, why did you then give the full ordination (to women) who were in love with boys or men, were distressed, and liked getting angry? After having received the full ordination, because they were thinking of men, they were distressed and angry, and quarreled with the other bhikkhunīs.” Then they told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha and criticized these bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you give the full ordination to women who were in love with boys or men, were distressed, and liked getting angry? After having received the full ordination, because they were thinking of men, they were distressed and angry, and quarreled with the other bhikkhunīs.” When he had criticized them in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Preliminary Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī gives the full ordination to a woman who is in love with a boy or a man, and is distressed and angry, it’s a pācittiya.’” In this way the World-honored One laid down the precept for the bhikkhunīs.


<h2>Second Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼，不知與童男男子相敬愛、不相敬愛，愁憂㥲恚者、不愁憂㥲恚者，後乃知與童男男子相敬愛，或有作波逸提懺者，或有疑者。「不知者無犯。自今已去當如是說戒：若比丘尼，知女人與童男男子相敬愛、愁憂㥲恚女人，度令出家受具足戒者，波逸提。」</lzh>
Then the bhikkhunīs didn’t know who was in love with a boy or a man and who wasn’t, and who was distressed and angry and who wasn’t, and they only found out later that someone was in love with a boy or a man. Some confessed a pācittiya. Some had doubts. (The Buddha said:) “If you don’t know, there’s no offense. From now on, you should recite the precept like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī knows that a woman is in love with a boy or a man, and that she’s a distressed and angry woman, and gives her the going forth and the full ordination, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>童男男子相敬愛與私通、</lzh>
“Being in love with a boy or a man” means having an affair.

<lzh>愁憂㥲恚者與受具足戒已，念彼男子故，與比丘尼共鬪諍。</lzh>
“Being distressed and angry” means to quarrel with the other bhikkhunīs after having received the full ordination because one is thinking of a man.

<lzh>彼比丘尼，知女人與童男男子相敬愛愁憂㥲恚，與授具足戒，三羯磨竟，和上尼，波逸提。白二羯磨，三突吉羅。白一羯磨，二突吉羅。白已，一突吉羅。白未竟，突吉羅。未白前剃髮與授戒集眾眾滿，一切突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī knows that a woman is in love with a boy or a man, and that she’s distressed and angry, and gives her the full ordination, when they’ve carried out the three announcements, the preceptor commits a pācittiya. When they’ve carried out the motion and two announcements, it’s three dukkaṭas. When they’ve carried out the motion and one announcement, it’s two dukkaṭas. When they’ve carried out the motion, it’s one dukkaṭa. If the motion hasn’t yet been finished, it’s a dukkaṭa. If they haven’t yet done the motion, when they shave her head, when they give her the precepts, when they gather the sangha, or when the assembly is complete, in all cases it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，若先不知，若信可信人語、若信父母語、若受具足戒已病生，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she doesn’t know at first, if she believes a trustworthy person’s words, if she believes her parents’ words, or if after she has given her the full ordination, an illness arises, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 135th rule.)
