<h2>First Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時偷羅難陀比丘尼，向暮至居士家就座而坐，隨坐時頃，不語主人開門而去。時有賊先常有心欲偷其家，遇見門開，即入偷其財物去。時居士問言：「向暮誰開門出去？」答言：「是偷羅難陀比丘尼。」時居士即譏嫌言：「此比丘尼，不知慚愧、不與取，外自稱言：『我知正法。』如是有何正法？乃與賊同謀偷我財物，如賊女婬女無異。」</lzh>
Then Thullanandā bhikkhunī went to a householder’s home around dusk and just sat down on a seat. Having sat there for a moment, she opened the gate and left without telling the owner. Then there were some criminals who earlier had often thought about breaking into that house. When they happened to see that the gate was open, they entered, stole their valuables, and left. Then the householder asked: “Who opened the gate around dusk and left?” Someone answered: “This Thullanandā bhikkhunī.” Then the householder was upset and said: “This bhikkhunī knows no shame, she takes what isn’t given. Outwardly, she praises herself: ‘I know the true dhamma’, how is that the true dhamma? Then she plans to steal my valuables together with criminals. There’s no difference to criminals and prostitutes.”

<lzh>諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，呵責偷羅難陀言：「汝云何向暮至居士家？」即白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責偷羅難陀言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何向暮至居士家？」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，向暮至白衣家者，波逸提。」如是世尊與比丘尼結戒。</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They criticized Thullanandā: “Why did go to a householder’s home around dusk?” Then they told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha and criticized Thullanandā: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did go to a householder’s home around dusk?” When he had criticized her in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “This bhikkhunī has all kinds of taints, and is the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Preliminary Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī goes to a lay person’s home around dusk, it’s a pācittiya.’” In this way the World-honored One laid down the precept for the bhikkhunīs.


<h2>Second Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>時諸比丘尼，欲營佛法僧事，若有瞻病事，或為檀越喚，皆有疑而不敢去。佛言：「自今已去若有請喚者聽往。自今已去當如是說戒：若比丘尼，向暮至白衣家，先不被喚，波逸提。」</lzh>
Then the bhikkhunīs wanted to attend to matters of the Buddha, the dhamma, and the sangha, they looked after the sick, or were summoned by supporters. They all had doubts and didn’t dare to go. The Buddha said: “From now on, if you’re invited or summoned, I allow to go. From now on, you should recite the precept like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī, without first having been summoned, goes to a lay person’s home around dusk, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼，向暮至白衣家，先不被請喚入門，波逸提。一脚在門外、一脚在門內，若方便欲去而不去，若共期去而不去者，一切突吉羅。彼比丘尼，若至白衣家隨住時頃，不語主人而去，出門者波逸提。方便欲去而不去，若共期去而不去，一切突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī, without first having been invited or summoned, goes to a lay person’s home around dusk and enters through the gate, it’s a pācittiya. If she has one foot outside the gate and one foot inside, if she plans and wishes to go but doesn’t go, or if she makes an appointment to go but doesn’t go, all cases are dukkaṭas. If a bhikkhunī goes to a lay person’s home, stays there for a moment, and leaves without telling the owner, when she goes through the gate it’s a pācittiya. If she plans and wishes to go but doesn’t go, or if she makes an appointment to go but doesn’t go, all cases are dukkaṭas.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，若為佛法僧事，若瞻視病事，若被請喚去，或為強力者所執，若被繫縛將去，或命難、梵行難，先不喚而去至彼家，隨所住時頃語主人而去，若彼舍為火所燒崩壞，或有毒蛇或有賊或有惡獸，或為強力者所執，若繫縛將去，或命難、梵行難，不語主人而出者，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she attends to matters of the Buddha, the dhamma, and the sangha, or if she looks after the sick, if she’s invited or summoned and goes, if she’s held by force, if she’s arrested and made to go, if her life is in danger, or if her celibacy is in danger, and she goes to someone’s home without first being summoned; or if she stays there for a moment and leaves after telling the owner, if that house is on fire and collapses, if there’s a poisonous snake, a criminal, or a savage animal, if she’s held by force, if she’s arrested and made to go, if her life is in danger, or if her celibacy is in danger, and she leaves without telling the owner, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 161st rule.)
