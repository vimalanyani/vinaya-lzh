<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>爾時舍衛諸居士，請讖摩比丘尼共立制度：「我等共供養眾僧乃至安居竟。」讖摩比丘尼安居竟，而彼即住不去。時諸居士皆譏嫌言：「我等先有制度，請讖摩比丘尼來，共供養眾僧，乃至安居竟。讖摩比丘尼而今安居竟，猶故不去。」</lzh>
At that time, householders in Sāvatthī had invited Khemā bhikkhunī and had set a rule: “We’ll provide for the sangha until the end of the rains retreat.” Khemā bhikkhunī’s rains retreat was over, but she then stayed on and didn’t leave. Then the householders were all upset and said: “We’ve previously set a rule: we’ll invite Khemā bhikkhunī to come and together provide for the sangha until the end of the rains retreat. Now Khema bhikkhunī’s rains retreat is over, but as before, she doesn’t leave.”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責讖摩比丘尼言：「諸居士共立制度，請讖摩比丘尼來，共供養眾僧至安居竟。今安居已訖，故住不去。」爾時諸比丘尼往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責讖摩比丘尼：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何居士供養汝夏安居，今者已訖，云何故住，使諸居士譏嫌？」爾時世尊以無數方便呵責讖摩比丘尼已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼夏安居訖不去者，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked Khemā bhikkhunī: “The householders set a rule: we’ll invite Khemā bhikkhunī to come, and together provide for the sangha until the end of the rains retreat. Now the rains retreat is over, but you stay on as before and don’t leave.” Then the bhikkhunīs went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized Khemā bhikkhunī: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. When the householders have provided for you during the rains retreat and it’s now already over, why do you stay on as before and make the householders upset?” Then, when the World-honored One had criticized Khemā bhikkhunī in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “This bhikkhunī has all kinds of taints, and is the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī, when the rains retreat is over, doesn’t leave, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>若比丘尼安居竟，應出行乃至一宿。若比丘尼安居竟不出行，波逸提。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī has finished the rains retreat, she should leave, even just one night. If a bhikkhunī has finished the rains retreat and doesn’t leave, it’s a pācittiya.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，夏安居訖去，若彼居士更請住，我當更供養；若家家傳食、若親里男女請，今日食或明日食，若遇病無伴瞻視者、或水難、或惡獸難、或賊難、或水瀑漲、或為強力所執、或被繫縛、或命難、梵行難，如是諸難夏安居訖不出行者，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she leaves when the rains retreat is over, if the householders invite her to stay on (and say): “We’ll still provide for you,” if she goes from house to house to receive food, if male or female relatives invite her: “Eat today” or “Eat tomorrow,” if she becomes sick and she has no companion to look after her, if there’s a danger from water, if there’s a danger from savage animals, if there’s a danger from criminals, if there’s flooding, if if she’s held by force, if she’s arrested, if her life is in danger, or if her celibacy is in danger, and in difficulties like these, she doesn’t leave when the rains retreat is over, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 96th rule.)
