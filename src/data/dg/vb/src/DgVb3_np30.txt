<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在毘舍離。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Vesālī.

<lzh>時毘舍離梨奢有因緣應從一居士得財物。有一迦羅比丘尼，常出入其家以為檀越。時梨奢語此迦羅比丘尼言：「阿姨！我欲及一財物事，能為我辦不？」答言：「能。」即為辦之。彼得財物歡喜，語言：「阿姨！欲得何物？」報言：「止！此便為供養我已。」彼復語言：「若有所須便說。」報言：「且止！正使我有所須，俱不見與。」彼報言：「當與，非為不與，但說。」即指示一輕衣價直五百張疊，語言：「我須如是衣。」時居士皆共譏嫌言：「比丘尼受取無厭，外自稱言：『我知正法。』如是何有正法？乃索價直五百張疊衣，正使檀越施與，猶應知足。」即持衣與已，如是言：「若我往者，自足辦事，乃不失此衣。」</lzh>
Then a Licchavi from Vesālī for some reason was to obtain some goods from a householder. There was a certain Kālī bhikkhunī who often went in and out of that house. They were her supporters. Then the Licchavi said to Kālī bhikkhunī: “Venerable, I’d like to settle this matter with those goods. Can you take care of it for me?” She replied: “I can.” Then she took care of it. They obtained the goods and asked her happily: “Venerable, what do you want to receive?” She replied: “Enough. This is for having offered things to me.” They said again: “If there’s anything you need, tell me.” She replied: “Enough. Even if I needed something, I don’t see at all how it’d be given.” They replied: “I’ll give it, I won’t not give it. Just tell me.” Then she pointed at a light cloth worth 500 panels of cotton cloth, and said: “I need a cloth like this.” Then the householders were all upset and said: “This bhikkhunī takes without limit. Outwardly, she praises herself: ‘I know the true dhamma’, how is that the true dhamma? She then asks for a cloth worth 500 panels of cotton cloth. Even if a supporter offers it, she should still know moderation.” They then took the cloth and gave it, and said: “If I had gone, I could’ve fully taken care of this matter, and then I wouldn’t have lost this cloth.”

<lzh>時有跋陀迦毘羅比丘尼，還至親里家就座而坐。時居士問言：「阿姨！欲須何物？」報言：「且止！便為供養我已。」復言：「但說無苦，欲須何物？」報言：「止不須說，正使欲有所須，俱不見與。」報言：「當與，非為不與，欲須何物？」即指示直五百張疊輕衣言：「我須此衣。」時彼居士譏嫌言：「此比丘尼受取無厭，外自稱言：『我知正法。』如是有何正法？乃索直五百張疊輕衣，正使檀越施與，猶應知足。」即與衣已便言：「比丘尼何用此貴價衣為？」</lzh>
Then, Bhaddā Kāpilānī bhikkhunī returned to her relatives’ house and sat down on a seat. The householders asked: “Venerable, what do you need or want?” She replied: “Enough. You’ve already offered to me.” They asked again: “Just tell us without worries, what do you want or need?” She replied: “Enough. I don’t need to speak. Even if I wanted some necessity, I don’t see at all how it’d be given.” They replied: “We’ll give it, we won’t not give it. What do you want or need?” Then she pointed at a light cloth worth 500 panels of cotton cloth, and said: “I need this cloth.” Then the householders were upset and said: “This bhikkhunī takes without limit. Outwardly, she praises herself: ‘I know the true dhamma’, how is that the true dhamma? She then asks for a light cloth worth 500 panels of cotton cloth. Even if a supporter offers it, she should still know moderation.” Then, when they had given her the cloth, they added: “For what purpose is this bhikkhunī going to use this expensive cloth?”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責迦羅跋陀迦毘羅比丘尼：「云何乃從彼索直五百張疊輕衣？」時諸比丘尼往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊爾時以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責迦羅跋陀迦毘羅比丘尼：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何汝等比丘尼，乃從彼索價直五百張疊輕衣？」時世尊以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此迦羅跋陀迦毘羅比丘尼！多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，欲乞輕衣，極至價直兩張半疊，過者尼薩耆波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked Kālī and Bhaddā Kāpilānī bhikkhunīs: “Why did you ask for a light cloth worth 500 panels of cotton cloth from others?” Then the bhikkhunīs went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized Kālī and Bhaddā Kāpilānī bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why, bhikkhunīs, did you ask for a light cloth worth 500 panels of cotton cloth from others?” Then, when the World-honored One had criticized them in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These Kālī and Bhaddā Kāpilānī bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī wants to ask for a light cloth, it may be worth two and a half panels of cotton cloth at most. If she exceeds that, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>輕衣者，障熱衣。</lzh>
“A light cloth” means a cloth to protect oneself from the heat.

<lzh>衣者，有十種如上。</lzh>
“A cloth” means there are 10 kinds of cloths, as above.

<lzh>若比丘尼乞輕衣時極至齊十條，若比丘尼乞輕衣過二張半疊，尼薩耆波逸提。此尼薩耆應捨與僧如上。捨竟懺悔如上法。僧即應還彼捨衣，白二羯磨還如上。若不還，若受作五衣乃至作非衣數數著，一切突吉羅如上。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī asks for a light cloth, it may consist of up to 10 strips at most. If a bhikkhunī asks for a light cloth worth more than two and a half panels of cotton cloth, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. This nissaggiya should be relinquished to the sangha, as above. When she has relinquished it, she should confess as in the rule above. The sangha should then return the relinquished cloth to her in a formal act with a motion as second to return it as above. If they don’t return it, if they accept it and make the five robes out of it, … if they turn it into something other than a robe, or if they frequently wear it, in all cases it’s a dukkaṭa as above.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，乞價直兩張半疊、若減二張半、若從出家者乞、若為他乞、他為己乞、不乞而得，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she asks for something worth two and a half panels of cotton cloth, or something worth less than two and a half panels, if she asks from renunciates, if she asks for others or others ask for her, or if she obtains it without asking, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 30th rule.)
