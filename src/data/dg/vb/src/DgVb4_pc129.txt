<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼多度弟子，後皆離和上去，不被教授、不按威儀、著衣不齊整、乞食不如法、處處受不淨食、或受不淨鉢食、在小食大食上高聲大喚，如婆羅門聚會法。時諸比丘尼見已問言：「諸姊！汝等何故不按威儀，著衣不齊整、乞食不如法、處處受不淨食、或受不淨鉢食、在小食大食上高聲大喚，如婆羅門聚會法？」諸比丘尼報言：「我等受具足已離和上去，不被教授故耳。」</lzh>
Then, the bhikkhunīs ordained many students, and later, they all left their preceptors. They weren’t instructed by them, not established in proper conduct, didn’t wear their robes neatly, did their almsround not according to dhamma, accepted improper food here and there, or accepted food in improper bowls, and shouted loudly during breakfast and lunch like at a gathering of brahmins. When the bhikkhunīs saw them, they asked: “Sisters, why aren’t you established in proper conduct, don’t wear your robes neatly, do your almsround not according to dhamma, accept improper food here and there, accept food in improper bowls, and shout loudly during breakfast and lunch like at a gathering of brahmins?” These bhikkhunīs replied: “After we received the full ordination, we left our preceptors. Because we weren’t instructed by them, (we’re like this.)”

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責諸比丘尼言：「汝等云何受具足已離和上去，不被教授、不按威儀、著衣服不齊整、乞食不如法、處處受不淨食、或受不淨鉢食、在小食大食上高聲大喚，如婆羅門聚會法？」時諸比丘尼呵責已，往白諸比丘，諸比丘白佛。佛以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責諸比丘尼：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何受具足戒已離和上去，不被教授、不按威儀、乞食不如法、處處受不淨食、或受不淨鉢食、在小食大食上高聲大喚，如婆羅門聚會法？」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，不二歲隨和上尼者，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked these bhikkhunīs: “Why did you, after receiving the full ordination, leave your preceptors? You weren’t instructed by them, weren’t established in proper conduct, didn’t wear your robes neatly, did your almsround not according to dhamma, accepted improper food here and there, or accepted food in improper bowls, and shouted loudly during breakfast and lunch like at a gathering of brahmins.” When the bhikkhunīs had criticized them, they went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus told the Buddha. The Buddha for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha and criticized these bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you, after receiving the full ordination, leave your preceptors? You weren’t instructed by them, weren’t established in proper conduct, didn’t wear your robes neatly, did your almsround not according to dhamma, accepted improper food here and there, or accepted food in improper bowls, and shouted loudly during breakfast and lunch like at a gathering of brahmins.” When he had criticized them in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī doesn’t follow her preceptor for two years, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼，不二歲隨和上尼者，波逸提。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī doesn’t follow her preceptor for two years, it’s a pācittiya.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，受具足戒已二歲隨尼和上；若和上聽去得去；若和上破戒、破見、破威儀，若被舉、若滅擯、若應滅擯；若由是事命難、梵行難，於二歲中離去，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she, after receiving the full ordination, follows her preceptor for two years. If the preceptor allows her to go, she may go. If the preceptor has broken the precepts, or has broken right view, or has broken proper conduct, and has been suspended, has been permanently expelled, or should be permanently expelled, and if for these reasons (the first bhikkhunī’s) life is in danger, or her celibacy is in danger, and she leaves during the two years, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 129th rule.)
