<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在羅閱祇耆闍崛山中。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Rājagaha on Vulture’s peak.

<lzh>時有一六群比丘尼，夜大小便器中，明旦不看牆外棄之。時有不信樂大臣，清旦乘車欲問訊洴沙王，路由比丘尼精舍邊過。尼所棄大小便，墮此大臣頭上，污身衣服。時大臣念言：「我當向官斷事人說此事。」時有篤信知相婆羅門言：「欲何所詣？」大臣答言：「比丘尼以大小便污辱我，我欲向官斷事人言。」知相婆羅門諫言：「且止！勿以此事向官言，或不成事更得其罪。」</lzh>
Then there was a group-of-six bhikkhunī who defecated and urinated into a chamber pot at night, and threw it over a wall without looking at dawn. Then there was a high official without joyous faith, who drove in his carriage at dawn, wanting to greet king Bimbisāra. The road passed by the bikkhunī monastery. The excrements and urine thrown out by the bhikkhunī fell on this high official’s head and soiled his body and clothes. Then the high official thought: “I’ll tell the judge about this matter.” Then there was a brahmin with deep faith who was skilled in signs and who said: “Where do you want to go?” The high official answered: “A bhikkhunī has soiled and disgraced me with excrement and urine. I want to speak with the judge.” The brahmin skilled in signs admonished him: “Stop it. Don’t speak with the judge about this matter. You might not be successful, and might still incur his punishment.” 

<lzh>時此大臣隨語便還。彼知相婆羅門，即詣比丘尼精舍，問：「何等比丘尼，夜以器盛大小便，不看牆外棄之？」諸比丘尼答言：「我等不知。」諸比丘尼言：「何故問此事？」時婆羅門以此因緣具向諸比丘尼說：「我已呵諫此大臣令止，自今已去後莫復爾。」諸比丘尼即自相檢校，誰為此事？即知六群比丘尼中有作此事者。時諸比丘尼呵責六群比丘尼：「云何汝夜大小便器中，明旦不看牆外棄之？」</lzh>
Then this high official followed the advice and turned back. That brahmin skilled in signs then went to the bhikkhunī monastery and asked: “What kind of bhikkhunī defecates and urinates into a chamber pot at night, and throws it over a wall without looking?” The bhikkhunīs answered: “We don’t know.” They said: “Why do you ask about this?” Then the brahmin for this reason fully explained the situation to the bhikkhunīs: “I’ve already criticized and admonished this high official to make him stop. From now on, don’t do it again.” The bhikkhunīs then interrogated each other who had done this. They found out that one of the group-of-six bhikkhunīs had done it. Then the bhikkhunīs criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunī: “Why did you defecate and urinate into a chamber pot at night, and throw it over a wall without looking at dawn?”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責六群比丘尼：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何六群比丘尼？夜大小便器中，不看牆外棄之？」時世尊以無數方便呵責六群比丘尼已，告諸比丘：「此六群比丘尼！多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，夜大小便器中，晝不看牆外棄者，波逸提。」</lzh>
Then the bhikkhunīs went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunī: What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why, group-of-six bhikkhunī, did you defecate and urinate into a chamber pot at night, and throw it over a wall without looking?” Then, when the World-honored One had criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunī in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “This group-of-six bhikkhunī has all kinds of taints, and is the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī defecates and urinates into a chamber pot at night, and throws it over a wall without looking during the day, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼，夜大小便器中，晝日當看牆外然後棄之。若夜起者，要先彈指謦欬。若比丘尼，夜大小便器中，晝不看牆外棄者，波逸提。若夜不謦欬、不彈指棄者，突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī defecates and urinates into a chamber pot at night, she should look over the wall and then throw it away during the day. If she gets up at night, she has to snap her fingers and clear her throat. If a bhikkhunī defecates and urinates into a chamber pot at night, and throws it over a wall without looking during the day, it’s a pācittiya. If she doesn’t clear her throat and snap her fingers at night, and throws it away, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，夜大小便器中，晝則看牆外棄之；若夜彈指謦欬；若彼有瓦、有石、若有樹株、若有刺諸不淨之處棄；若有汪水、若有坑岸、若有糞聚者，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she defecates and urinates into a chamber pot at night, and then looks and throws it over a wall during the day, if she snaps her fingers and clears her throat at night, if there are clay, stones, tree stumps, or brambles, and she throws it away in these unclean places, or into a pool of water, on the sides of a pit, or on a dung heap, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 78th rule.)
