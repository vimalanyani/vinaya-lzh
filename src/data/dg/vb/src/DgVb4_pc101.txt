<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>爾時六群比丘尼，露身在河水、泉水、池水、深水中浴。時有賊女婬女，往比丘尼所語言：「汝等年少腋下未生毛，云何便出家學道修梵行耶？如今年少，可於愛欲中共相娛樂，老時可修梵行，如是二事俱得。」其中年少者聞便生不樂心。時諸居士見皆共譏嫌言：「此諸比丘尼不知慚愧，外自稱言：『我知正法。』如是有何正法？而露身形在河泉池深水中浴，如婬女賊女無異。」</lzh>
Then the group-of-six bhikkhunīs bathed naked in a river, a spring, a pond, and deep water<note> Variant reading: a canal.</note>. Female criminals and prostitutes went to the bhikkhunīs and said: “You’re young, hair doesn’t yet grow below your armpits. Why did you go forth to train in the path and practise celibacy? As you’re now young, you can amuse yourselves in the passions with each other, and when you’re old you can practise celibacy. Like this, you’ll fully obtain two things.” When the younger women among them heard this, dissatisfaction arose in their minds. When the householders saw this, they were all upset and said: “These bhikkhunīs know no shame. Outwardly, they praise themselves: ‘We know the true dhamma’, how is that the true dhamma? They bathe naked in a river, a spring, a pond, and deep water<note> Variant reading: a canal.</note>. There’s no difference to prostitutes and criminals.”

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責六群比丘尼言：「云何汝等露形在河、泉、池、深水中浴耶？」時諸比丘尼白諸比丘，諸比丘往白佛。佛爾時以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責六群比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何比丘尼，露形在河、池、泉、深水中浴耶？」時世尊以無數方便呵責六群比丘尼已，告諸比丘：「此六群比丘尼！多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼露身形在河水、泉水、深水、池水中浴者，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “Why did you bathe naked in a river, a spring, a pond, and deep water?” Then the bhikkhunīs told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the Buddha. The Buddha then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why, bhikkhunīs, did you bathe naked in a river, a pond, a spring, and deep water?” When the World-honored One had criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These group-of-six bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī bathes naked in a river, a spring, deep water,<note> The pātimokkha says “a stream” instead of “deep water”.</note> or a pond, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼應以四事覆形洗浴，若在流水岸側曲迴處，若復有樹蔭覆處，若復水覆障，若以衣障身。上三事不得相取與器物；以衣障者，一切如法事得作。彼比丘尼，若露形在河、池、泉、深水中洗浴身，盡漬，波逸提。不盡漬，突吉羅。方便欲洗而不洗，共期而不去，一切突吉羅。</lzh>
A bhikkhunī should conceal her body with four things to bathe. Either with a place where the bank of the river bends, or with a place where the shade of a tree conceals her, or if the water is screened off, or if her body is concealed by a robe. In the first three situations, she may not give and take utensils from others. If she’s concealed by a robe, she may do everything that’s according to dhamma. If a bhikkhunī bathes naked in a river, a pond, a spring, or deep water, and if she’s completely immersed, it’s a pācittiya. If she’s not completely immersed, it’s a dukkaṭa. If she plans and wants to bathe but doesn’t bathe, or if she makes an appointment but doesn’t go, in all cases it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，水岸曲迴處、樹蔭覆處、水覆障、若以衣障形、若為強力所執，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if it’s in a place where the river bank bends, if it’s in a place that’s concealed by the shade of a tree, if the water is screened off, if her body is concealed by a robe, or if she’s held by force, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 101st rule.)
