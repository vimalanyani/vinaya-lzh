<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時六群比丘尼，以小事便共瞋恚作呪詛言墮三惡道、不生佛法中：「我若作是事者，使我墮三惡道、不生佛法中；若汝作是事者，亦墮三惡道、不生佛法中。」</lzh>
Then the group-of-six bhikkhunīs because of some small matter, angrily cursed someone to fall into the three paths of misery, and to not be born into the Buddha’s dhamma: “If I’ve done such a thing, may it make me fall into the three paths of misery, may I not be born into the Buddha’s dhamma; if you’ve done such a thing, may you also fall into the three paths of misery, may you not be born into the Buddha’s dhamma.”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責六群比丘尼：「云何汝等自有小事便㥲恚作是呪詛言墮三惡道、不生佛法中：『若我有是事，使我墮三惡道、不生佛法中；若汝有是事，亦墮三惡道、不生佛法中。』」時諸比丘尼往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊爾時以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責六群比丘尼：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何六群比丘尼，自有小事便㥲恚作是呪詛言墮三惡道、不生佛法中：『若我有是事，使我入三惡道、不生佛法中；若汝有是事，亦當墮三惡道、不生佛法中。』」時世尊以無數方便呵責六群比丘尼已，告諸比丘：「此六群比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼有小因緣事便呪詛墮三惡道、不生佛法中：『若我有如是事，墮三惡道、不生佛法中；若汝有如是事，亦墮三惡道、不生佛法中。』波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “Why did you, because of some small matter, angrily curse someone to fall into the three paths of misery, and to not be born into the Buddha’s dhamma: ‘If I’ve done such a thing, may it make me fall into the three paths of misery, may I not be born into the Buddha’s dhamma; if you’ve done such a thing, may you also fall into the three paths of misery, may you not be born into the Buddha’s dhamma.’?” Then the bhikkhunīs went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why, group-of-six bhikkhunīs, did you, because of some small matter, angrily curse someone to fall into the three paths of misery, and to not be born into the Buddha’s dhamma: ‘If I’ve done such a thing, may it make me fall into the three paths of misery, may I not be born into the Buddha’s dhamma; if you’ve done such a thing, may you also fall into the three paths of misery, may you not be born into the Buddha’s dhamma.’?” Then, when the World-honored One had criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These group-of-six bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī, for some insignificant reason, curses someone to fall into the three paths of misery, and to not be born into the Buddha’s dhamma: “If I’ve done such a thing, may I fall into the three paths of misery, may I not be born into the Buddha’s dhamma; if you’ve done such a thing, may you also fall into the three paths of misery, may you not be born into the Buddha’s dhamma,” it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>佛言：「自今已去聽稱南無佛，若我有如是事南無佛；若汝有如是事，亦南無佛。」</lzh>
The Buddha said: “From now on, I allow to invoke the ‘Namo Buddha’: ‘If I’ve done such a thing, namo Buddha (hommage to the Buddha); if you’ve done such a thing, also namo Buddha.’”

<lzh>彼比丘尼有小事便自呪詛墮三惡道、不生佛法中：「若我有是事，墮三惡道、不生佛法中；若汝有是事，亦入三惡道、不生佛法中。」說而了了者，波逸提；不了了者，突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī, because of some small matter, curses someone to fall into the three paths of misery, and to not be born into the Buddha’s dhamma: “If I’ve done such a thing, may I fall into the three paths of misery, may I not be born into the Buddha’s dhamma; if you’ve done such a thing, may you also enter into the three paths of misery, may you not be born into the Buddha’s dhamma,” and if she speaks and the other understands, it’s a pācittiya. If she doesn’t understand, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，若言南無佛、或戲笑語、或疾疾語、或獨語、或夢中語、或欲說此錯說彼，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she says “Namo Buddha”, if she says it jokingly, if she speaks quickly, if she speaks when she’s alone, if she speaks in a dream, or if she wants to say one thing but by mistake says something else, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 88th rule.)
