<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時六群比丘尼以非時衣受作時衣。諸比丘尼見語言：「世尊許比丘尼畜五衣，此衣是誰衣？」答言：「是我等時衣。」即語言：「妹！今是時非時。」</lzh>
Then the group-of-six bhikkhunīs accepted out-of-season cloth and turned it into in-season cloth. The other bhikkhunīs saw it and asked: “The World-honored One has allowed bhikkhunīs to keep five robes, whose cloth is this cloth?” They answered: “This is our in-season cloth.” Then they said: “Younger sisters, now is out-of-season time.”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責六群比丘尼：「云何汝等以非時衣受作時衣？」諸比丘尼白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊爾時以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責六群比丘尼：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何六群比丘尼！以非時衣受作時衣？」時世尊以無數方便呵責六群比丘尼已，告諸比丘：「此六群比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，以非時衣受作時衣者，尼薩耆波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “Why did you accept out-of-season cloth and turn it into in-season cloth?” Then the bhikkhunīs told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why, group-of-six bhikkhunīs, did you accept out-of-season cloth and turn it into in-season cloth?” Then, when the World-honored One had criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These group-of-six bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī accepts out-of-season cloth and turns it into in-season cloth, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>時者，安居竟，無迦絺那衣一月、有迦絺那衣五月。</lzh>
“In-season cloth” means when the rains retreat has ended and there’s no kaṭhina robe, it’s one month. If there’s a kaṭhina robe, five months.

<lzh>非時者，除此於餘時得長衣是。</lzh>
“Out-of-season cloth” means except for the above, if she obtains a spare cloth at another time.

<lzh>衣者，有十種衣如上。</lzh>
“A cloth” means there are 10 kinds of cloths, as above.

<lzh>若比丘尼，以此非時衣受作時衣者，尼薩耆波逸提。此尼薩耆應捨與僧如上。捨竟懺悔如上。僧即應還彼所捨衣，白二羯磨還如上。若不還，受作五衣乃至數數著，一切突吉羅如上。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī accepts out-of-season cloth and turns it into in-season cloth, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. This nissaggiya should be relinquished to the sangha, as above. When she has relinquished it, she should confess as above. The sangha should then return the relinquished robe to her in a formal act with a motion to return it as second as above. If they don’t return it, if they accept it and make the five robes out of it, … or if they frequently wear it, in all cases it’s a dukkaṭa as above.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，非時衣受作非時衣，時衣受作時衣，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she accepts out-of-season cloth and turns it into out-of-season cloth, or if she accepts in-season cloth and turns it into in-season cloth, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 27th rule.)

<lzh>(二十七竟)</lzh>
