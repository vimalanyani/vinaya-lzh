<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時六群比丘尼欲心熾盛顏色憔悴身體羸瘦，往詣波斯匿王宮內。宮內諸婦女見已問言：「阿姨有何患苦？」答言：「我有色患。」即問言：「有何等色患？」答言：「我欲心熾盛。」諸婦女言：「我在宮內，時時乃得男子。若不得男子時，或以胡膠作男根內著女根中，既得適意不名行婬。阿姨亦可作如是，既得適意不名行婬。」時有二六群比丘尼，作如是男根已共行婬事，餘比丘尼見謂共男子行婬，見起已方知非男子。</lzh>
Then the group-of-six bhikkhunīs, burning with lustful minds, looking haggard, with weak and feeble bodies, went inside the palace of King Pasenadi. When the women in the palace saw them, they asked: “Venerables, from what do you suffer?” They answered: “We have a sexual suffering.” Then they asked: “What kind of sexual suffering do you have?” They answered: “We’re burning with a lustful mind.” The women said: “We’re inside the palace. From time to time, we obtain a man. If we don’t obtain a man, some make a dildo out of gum and insert it into the vagina. Then they’re able enjoy themselves, and it’s not called engaging in sexual intercourse. The venerables can do this. Then you’ll be able to enjoy yourselves, and it’s not called engaging in sexual intercourse.” Then there were two group-of-six bhikkhunīs who made such a dildo and together engaged in sexual practices. The other bhikkhunīs saw them and said: “She’s having sex with a man.” When they saw them get up, then they knew that it wasn’t a man.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責六群比丘尼言：「云何汝等以胡膠作男根共行婬？」時諸比丘尼往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責六群比丘尼：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何六群比丘尼！以此胡膠作男根共行婬？」時世尊以無數方便呵責六群比丘尼已，告諸比丘：「此六群比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼以胡膠作男根，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “Why did you make a dildo out of gum and engage in sexual intercourse?” Then the bhikkhunīs went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why, group-of-six bhikkhunīs, did you make a dildo out of gum and engage in sexual intercourse?” Then, when the World-honored One had criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These group-of-six bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī makes a dildo out of gum, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>作男根者，用諸物作、或以胡膠作、若飯作、或用麨作、或蠟作。</lzh>
“Making a dildo” means using these things to make it: using gum, cooked rice, flour, or wax.

<lzh>若比丘尼，以此諸物作男根內女根中者，一切波逸提。若不摩治內女根中者，突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī makes a dildo with these things and inserts it into the vagina, in all cases it’s a pācittiya. If she doesn’t take it and put it into the vagina, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼、突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，或有如是病、著果藥及丸藥、或衣塞月水、或為強力者所執，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she has a certain illness, if she applies medicinal fruits or pills of medicine, if it’s a cloth to absorb the menstrual fluid, or if she’s held by force, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 73rd rule.)
