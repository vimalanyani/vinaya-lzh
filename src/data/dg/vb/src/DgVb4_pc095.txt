<h2>First Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時六群比丘尼，春夏冬一切時人間遊行。時遇暴雨河水汎漲，漂失衣鉢、尼師檀、針筒，踏殺生草。時諸居士見皆共譏嫌言：「此比丘尼，不知慚愧、斷眾生命，外自稱言：『我知正法。』如是有何正法？云何比丘尼，春夏冬一切時人間遊行，遇天暴雨河水汎漲漂失雜物，又踏殺生草斷眾生命？」</lzh>
Then the group-of-six bhikkhunīs wandered among the people at all times: during spring, summer, and winter. They encountered torrential rain and the rivers overflowed. Their robes, bowls, sitting mats, and needle cases were washed away and lost, and they trod on and killed the fresh grass. When the householders saw them, they were all upset and said: “These bhikkhunīs know no shame, they take many lives. Outwardly, they praise themselves: ‘We know the true dhamma’, how is that the true dhamma? Why do these bhikkhunīs wander among the people at all times: during spring, summer, and winter? They encountered torrential rain from the sky and the rivers overflowed. Various things were washed away and lost, and moreover they trod on and killed the fresh grass. They took many lives.”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，呵責六群比丘尼：「云何汝等，春夏冬一切時人間遊行，遇雨河水汎漲漂失衣物，踏殺生草，使居士譏嫌？」時諸比丘尼往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊爾時以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責六群比丘尼：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何六群比丘尼！春夏冬一切時人間遊行，遇雨河水汎漲漂失衣物，踏殺生草，使居士等譏嫌？」時世尊以無數方便呵責六群比丘尼已，告諸比丘：「此六群比丘尼！多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，春夏冬一切時人間遊行者，波逸提。」如是世尊與比丘尼結戒。</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “Why did you wander among the people at all times: during spring, summer, and winter? You encountered rain and the rivers overflowed. Your robes and things were washed away and lost, and you trod on and killed the fresh grass, which made the householders upset.” Then the bhikkhunīs went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why, group-of-six bhikkhunīs, did you wander among the people at all times: during spring, summer, and winter? You encountered rain and the rivers overflowed. Your robes and things were washed away and lost, and you trod on and killed the fresh grass, which made the householders upset.” When the World-honored One had criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These group-of-six bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Preliminary Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī wanders among the people at all times: during spring, summer, and winter, it’s a pācittiya.’” In this way the World-honored One laid down the precept for the bhikkhunīs.


<h2>Second Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>若彼比丘尼，為佛事法事僧事病比丘尼事。佛言：「聽受七日法出界去。自今已去當如是說戒：若比丘尼，春夏冬一切時人間遊行，除餘因緣者，波逸提。」</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī attends to matters of the Buddha, the dhamma, the sangha, or to a sick bhikkhunī’s matters, the Buddha has said: “I allow to undergo a seven-day procedure, and leave the territory. From now on, you should recite the precept like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī wanders among the people at all times: during spring, summer, and winter, unless there’s a suitable reason, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼春夏冬一切時人間遊行，隨入村界，一一波逸提。若無村無界處行十里間者，波逸提。減一村、減十里者，突吉羅。一村間行一界內者，突吉羅。方便欲去而不去，若共期去而不去，一切突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī wanders among the people at all times: during spring, summer, and winter, whenever she enters a village territory, each time is a pācittiya. If there’s no village and no place with a territory, whenever she walks 10 leagues, it’s a pācittiya. If she walks less than the distance of a village, or less than 10 leagues, it’s a dukkaṭa. If within one village, she walks in one territory, it’s a dukkaṭa. If she plans and wants to go but doesn’t go, or if she makes an appointment to go but doesn’t go, in all cases it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，為佛法僧事，為病比丘尼事，受七日法出界行；或為強者所執、或被縛去、或命難、或梵行難，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she attends to matters of the Buddha, the dhamma, the sangha, or to a sick bhikkhunī’s matters, she undergoes a seven-day procedure and leaves the territory, if she’s held by force, if she’s arrested and made to go, if her life is in danger, or if her celibacy is in danger, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 95th rule.)
