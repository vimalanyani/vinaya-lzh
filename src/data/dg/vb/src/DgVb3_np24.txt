<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時六群比丘尼，受持好色鉢，故者留置，彼畜多鉢而不洗治，狼藉在地。諸居士詣寺觀看，見已譏嫌言：「此比丘尼受取無厭，外自稱言：『我知正法。』如是何有正法？多畜好色鉢，故鉢狼藉在地，與瓦肆無異。」</lzh>
Then the group-of-six bhikkhunīs determined beautiful bowls and put the old ones aside. They kept many bowls, but didn’t wash and arrange them, and put them on the ground in disorder. Householders came to the monastery and looked around. When they saw it, they were upset and said: “These bhikkhunīs take without limit. Outwardly, they praise themselves: ‘We know the true dhamma’, how is that the true dhamma? They keep many beautiful bowls, and the old bowls are in disorder on the ground. There’s no difference to a potter’s shop.”

<lzh>諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，呵責六群比丘尼：「汝云何多畜好色鉢，故鉢不洗治狼藉在地？」諸比丘尼往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊爾時以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責六群比丘尼：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何六群比丘尼！受持好色鉢，故者不洗治狼藉在地？」時世尊以無數方便呵責六群比丘尼已，告諸比丘：「此六群比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼畜長鉢，尼薩耆波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “Why did you keep many beautiful bowls, didn’t wash and arrange the old bowls, and put them on the ground in disorder?” Then the bhikkhunīs went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why, group-of-six bhikkhunīs, did you determine beautiful bowls, didn’t wash and arrange the old bowls, and put them on the ground in disorder?” Then, when the World-honored One had criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These group-of-six bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī keeps a spare bowl, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼，即日得鉢即日應受持一鉢，餘者當淨施、若遣與人。若比丘尼畜長鉢，尼薩耆波逸提。此尼薩耆，應捨與僧如上法，捨竟懺悔如上。僧即應還彼捨鉢，作白二羯磨還如上。若不還，乃至非鉢用，一切突吉羅如上。</lzh>
On the day that a bhikkhunī obtains a bowl, that very day she should determine one bowl, and the other should be turned into a pure offering <note> vikappana</note> or sent to others. If a bhikkhunī keeps a spare bowl, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. This nissaggiya should be relinquished to the sangha, as in the rule above. When she has relinquished it, she should confess as above. The sangha should then return the relinquished bowl to her, and carry out a formal act with a motion as second to return it as above. If they don’t return it, … if they use it as something other than a bowl, in all cases it’s a dukkaṭa as above. 

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，即日得鉢即日受一鉢，餘鉢淨施、或遣與人；若奪想、若失想、若破想、若漂想、不淨施、不遣與人，不犯。若奪鉢、若失鉢、若破鉢、若漂鉢、若自取用、若他與用，不犯。若所寄鉢者命終、若遠行、若休道、若為賊所將去、若遇惡獸難、為水所漂、不作淨施、不遣與人，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if on the day she obtains a bowl, that day she accepts one bowl, and turns the other bowl into a pure offering, or sends it to others; if she perceives the bowl as having been stolen, lost, broken, or washed away, and therefore she doesn’t turn it into a pure offering or send it to others, the offense isn’t committed. If her bowl is stolen, lost, broken, or washed away, and she herself takes and uses (the new one), or if others give it to her to use, the offense isn’t committed. If the person she has entrusted with the bowl dies, goes on a long journey, disrobes, is abducted by criminals, encounters danger from savage animals, or is washed away by water, and she doesn’t turn it into a pure offering or send it to others, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 24th rule.)
