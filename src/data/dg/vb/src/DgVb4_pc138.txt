<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時安隱比丘尼多度弟子，與授具足戒，不能一一教授。彼以不被教授故，不按威儀，著衣不齊整、乞食不如法、處處受不淨食、或受不淨鉢食、在小食大食上高聲大喚，如婆羅門聚會法。時諸比丘尼見已問言：「汝等何以不按威儀，著衣不齊整、乞食不如法、處處受不淨食、受不淨鉢食、在小食大食上高聲大喚，如婆羅門聚會法？」彼即報言：「我是安隱比丘尼弟子，師不教授我故耳。」</lzh>
Then Khemā bhikkhunī gave the full ordination to many students but couldn’t instruct all of them. Because they weren’t instructed, they weren’t established in proper conduct, didn’t wear their robes neatly, did their almsround not according to dhamma, accepted improper food here and there, or accepted food in improper bowls, and shouted loudly during breakfast and lunch like at a gathering of brahmins. When the bhikkhunīs saw them, they asked: “Why aren’t you established in proper conduct, don’t wear your robes neatly, do your almsround not according to dhamma, accept improper food here and there, accept food in improper bowls, and shout loudly during breakfast and lunch like at a gathering of brahmins?” They then replied: “We’re Khemā bhikkhunī’s students. Because out teacher doesn’t instruct us, (we’re like this.)”

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責安隱比丘尼言：「汝云何多度弟子，不能一一教授。彼以不被教授故，不按威儀，著衣不齊整、乞食不如法、處處受不淨食、受他不淨鉢食、在小食大食上高聲大喚，如婆羅門聚會法？」諸比丘尼往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責安隱比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何多度弟子，不能一一教授。彼以不被教授故，不按威儀，著衣不齊整、乞食不如法、處處受不淨食、或受他不淨鉢食、在小食大食上高聲大喚，如婆羅門聚會法？」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，不滿一歲授人具足戒者，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked Khemā bhikkhunī: “Why did you ordain many students but couldn’t instruct all of them? Because they weren’t instructed, they weren’t established in proper conduct, didn’t wear their robes neatly, did their almsround not according to dhamma, accepted improper food here and there, accepted food in improper bowls, and shouted loudly during breakfast and lunch like at a gathering of brahmins.” The bhikkhunīs went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha and criticized Khemā bhikkhunī: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you ordain many students but couldn’t instruct all of them? Because they weren’t instructed, they weren’t established in proper conduct, didn’t wear their robes neatly, did their almsround not according to dhamma, accepted improper food here and there, accepted food in improper bowls, and shouted loudly during breakfast and lunch like at a gathering of brahmins.” When he had criticized her in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “This bhikkhunī has all kinds of taints, and is the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī gives the full ordination to people more often than once a year, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>若比丘尼，滿十二月得授人具足戒，滿十二月得與人依止，滿十二月得授式叉摩那二歲學戒，滿十二月得度沙彌尼。彼比丘尼，不滿一歲授人具足戒者，波逸提。不滿一歲，與人依止，度式叉摩那、沙彌尼，突吉羅。</lzh>
A bhikkhunī may give the full ordination to someone once in 12 months, may give dependence to someone once in 12 months, may give the training precepts to a sikkhamānā for two years once in 12 months, and may ordain a sāmaṇerī once in 12 months. If a bhikkhunī gives the full ordination more often than once a year, it’s a pācittiya. If she gives dependence more often than once a year, or ordains a sikkhamānā or sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，滿十二月授人具足戒，滿十二月與人依止，授式叉摩那二歲學戒，度沙彌尼，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if, after 12 months, she gives the full ordination, or if, after 12 months, she gives dependence to someone, gives the training precepts to a sikkhamānā for two years, or ordains a sāmaṇerī, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 138th rule.)
