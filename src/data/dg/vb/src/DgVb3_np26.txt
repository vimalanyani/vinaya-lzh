<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼，月期水出污身衣坐具。諸比丘尼白諸比丘，諸比丘往白佛，佛言：「聽著遮月期衣，若脫聽安帶。月水猶從兩邊出污衣，更聽作病衣重著，外著涅槃僧。若至白衣舍應語言：『我有病。』若白衣語：『但坐無苦。』彼比丘尼當褰涅槃僧以此病衣遮身坐。」</lzh>
Then bhikkhunīs had their menses, and soiled their bodies, robes, and sitting mat. The bhikkhunīs told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the Buddha. The Buddha said: “I allow to wear a cloth to absorb the menstrual fluid. If it comes loose, I allow to wear a belt.” The menstrual fluid still came out on both sides and soiled the robes, and he allowed to make a menstrual robe and wear it as well, and to wear the lower robe<note> nivāsana.</note> on top. If they came to lay people’s houses, they should say: “I’m sick.” If the lay people said: “Just sit down without worries,” the bhikkhunīs should pull up their lower robes and sit down with this menstrual robe covering their bodies.

<lzh>時有旃檀輸那比丘尼，常自謂無有欲想，語餘一比丘尼言：「汝若月水出時從我取此衣。」彼報言：「可爾。」餘比丘尼常望此衣更不辦衣。於異時，栴檀輸那比丘尼月期水出，餘比丘尼亦月水出。時餘比丘尼遣使詣栴檀輸那比丘尼所語言：「前許我病衣，今可見與。」答言：「妹！我今亦月期水出，不得相與。」彼比丘尼嫌責栴檀輸那比丘尼言：「前語我：『若月期水出，從我取病衣。』我常望得衣、不自辦衣，而今往索，不與我耶？」</lzh>
Then there was Chandāsaññā bhikkhunī. She often said of herself that she didn’t have perceptions of desire. She said to another bhikkhunī: “When you have your menses, take this robe from me.” She replied: “Okay.” The other bhikkhunī always expected that robe and therefore didn’t prepare a robe. At another time, Chandāsaññā bhikkhunī had her menses, and the other bhikkhunī had it as well. Then the other bhikkhunī sent a messenger to Chandāsaññā bhikkhunī to say: “Previously, you promised me your menstrual robe. Now please give it.” She answered: “Younger sister, I now also have my menses, I’m not able to give it to you.” That bhikkhunī rebuked Chandāsaññā bhikkhunī: “Previously you told me: ‘When you have your menses, take a menstrual robe from me.’ I always expected to get the robe, and didn’t prepare a robe myself. But now when I go and ask for it, you won’t give it to me?”

<lzh>諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責栴檀輸那比丘尼：「汝云何許彼比丘尼病衣，使不自辦衣，今索不與？」時諸比丘尼往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊爾時以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責栴檀輸那比丘尼：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何栴檀輸那比丘尼！許彼病衣使不自辦，今索不與？」以無數方便呵責栴檀輸那比丘尼已，告諸比丘：「栴檀輸那比丘尼！多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，許他比丘尼病衣，後不與者，尼薩耆波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked Chandāsaññā bhikkhunī: “Why did you promise that bhikkhunī a menstrual robe, which led to her not preparing a robe herself, and now when she asks for it, you don’t give it?” Then the bhikkhunīs went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized Chandāsaññā bhikkhunī: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why, Chandāsaññā bhikkhunī, did you promise someone a menstrual robe, which led to her not preparing one herself, and now when she asks for it, you don’t give it?” Then, when he had criticized Chandāsaññā bhikkhunī in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “Chandāsaññā bhikkhunī has all kinds of taints, and is the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī promises another bhikkhunī a menstrual robe, but doesn’t give it later, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>病衣者，月水出時遮內身，上著涅槃僧。</lzh>
“A menstrual robe” means to cover the body underneath when she has her menses, and to wear the lower robe on top.

<lzh>衣者，有十種衣，如上。</lzh>
“A robe” means there are 10 kinds of cloths, as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼，許彼病衣不與者，尼薩耆波逸提。除病衣已，許餘衣不與者，突吉羅。除餘衣已，許餘所須物不與者，突吉羅。若比丘尼許比丘尼病衣，後不與，尼薩耆波逸提。此尼薩耆應捨與僧如上。捨已懺悔如上。僧即當還彼捨衣如上。若不還，受作五衣乃至數數用，一切突吉羅如上。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī promises another a menstrual robe and doesn’t give it, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. Except for the menstrual robe, if she promises another robe and doesn’t give it, it’s a dukkaṭa. Except for other robes, if she promises another essential item and doesn’t give it, it’s a dukkaṭa. If a bhikkhunī promises another bhikkhunī a menstrual robe and doesn’t give it later, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. This nissaggiya should be relinquished to the sangha, as above. When she has relinquished it, she should confess as above. The sangha should then return the relinquished robe to her as above. If they don’t return it, if they accept it and make the five robes out of it, … or if they frequently use it, in all cases it’s a dukkaṭa as above. 

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，許病衣與、若無病衣、若作病衣、若浣染打舉在牢處求不與，無犯。彼比丘尼，或破戒、或破見、或破威儀、若被舉、若滅擯、若應滅擯、若由此因緣命難、梵行難，許病衣不與，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she promises a menstrual robe and gives it, if there’s no menstrual robe, if she is making a menstrual robe, if she has washed, dyed, beaten, and hung it up in a locked place and doesn’t give it when asked, the offense isn’t committed. If the other bhikkhunī has broken the precepts, or has broken right view, or has broken proper conduct, and has been suspended, has been permanently expelled, or should be permanently expelled, and if for these reasons (the first bhikkhunī’s) life is in danger, or her celibacy is in danger, and she has promised a menstrual robe but doesn’t give it, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 26th rule.)
