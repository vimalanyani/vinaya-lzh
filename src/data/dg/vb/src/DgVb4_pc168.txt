<h2>First Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼，聞世尊制戒聽度弟子，便度負債人及諸病者與授具足戒已，債主來牽捉，若病者常須人守視不得遠離。</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard that the World-honored One had laid down a precept and allowed to ordain students, they ordained people in debt and those with many diseases. When they had given the full ordination, the creditors came and dragged them away, and the sick people often needed someone to look after them and weren’t able to stay apart.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責諸比丘尼言：「世尊制戒聽度人，汝云何度他負債人及病者，使債主牽捉、病者常須守視不得遠離耶？」即白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責諸比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行、所不應為。云何比丘尼，度他負債人及病者，債主牽捉、病者須人守視不得遠離耶？」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，度負債人及病者與授具足戒，波逸提。」如是世尊與比丘尼結戒。</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked these bhikkhunīs: “The World-honored One has laid down a precept and allowed to ordain someone. Why did you ordain people in debt and sick people? The creditors dragged them away, and the sick people often needed someone to look after them and weren’t able to stay apart.” Then they told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha and criticized these bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why, bhikkhunīs, did you ordain people in debt and sick people? The creditors dragged them away, and the sick people often needed someone to look after them and weren’t able to stay apart.” When he had criticized them in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Preliminary Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī gives the full ordination to people in debt and sick people, it’s a pācittiya.’” In this way the World-honored One laid down the precept for the bhikkhunīs.


<h2>Second Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>時諸比丘尼，不知有負債難、無負債難；若病難、不病難，後方知負債及病難者，中有作波逸提懺者，或有疑者。「不知者不犯。自今已去當如是結戒：若比丘尼，知有負債難者、病難者與授具足戒，波逸提。」</lzh>
Then the bhikkhunīs didn’t know if someone was in trouble because of debt or not, or if someone was in trouble because of disease or not. They only found out later that someone was in trouble because of debt and disease. Among them some confessed a pācittiya. Some had doubts. (The Buddha said:) “If you don’t know, there’s no offense. From now on, you should recite the precept like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī knows that someone is in trouble because of debt or disease, and gives her the full ordination, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>負債者，乃至一錢為十六分之一分也。</lzh>
“Debt” means even just the 16th part of one coin.

<lzh>病者，乃至常患頭痛。</lzh>
“Disease” means even just often suffering from headaches.

<lzh>彼比丘尼，知負債難及病難者度與授具足戒，白三羯磨竟，和上尼波逸提。白二羯磨，三突吉羅。白一羯磨，二突吉羅。白已，一突吉羅。白未竟，突吉羅。未白前若剃髮與授戒集眾眾滿，一切突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī knows that someone is in trouble because of debt or disease, and gives her the full ordination, when they’ve carried out the motion and the three announcements, the preceptor commits a pācittiya. When they’ve carried out the motion and two announcements, it’s three dukkaṭas. When they’ve carried out the motion and one announcement, it’s two dukkaṭas. When they’ve carried out the motion, it’s one dukkaṭa. If the motion hasn’t been finished yet, it’s a dukkaṭa. If they haven’t done the motion yet, when they shave her head, when they give her the precepts, when they gather the sangha, or when the assembly is complete, in all cases it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，先不知，若信彼人語、若信可信者語、若信父母語、若與授具足戒已負債若病，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she doesn’t know at first, if she believes that person’s words, if she believes a trustworthy person’s words, if she believes her parents’ words, or if after she has given her the full ordination, (the new bhikkhunī) gets debts or diseases, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 168th rule.)
