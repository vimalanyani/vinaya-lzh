<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時有比丘尼，到時著衣持鉢詣一居士家，到已居士婦敷一獨坐床令坐已，捨入屋內。此比丘尼坐須臾，不語主人便捨座去。適出門，有一摩納來入其家，四顧不見人，便作是念：「此床座於我有益。」即取持去。居士婦出，不見比丘尼，亦不見獨坐床，即遣信問比丘尼：「獨坐床為何所在？」比丘尼答言：「我不知。當我出時，有一摩納來入汝家，或彼持去，可從彼推求。」即往推求，還得床座。時諸居士皆共譏嫌言：「比丘尼不知慚愧，外自稱言：『我知正法。』如是有何正法？云何坐主人床坐，不語便捨去，如似婬女賊女無異？」</lzh>
Then there was a bhikkhunī who, when the right time had come, put on her robes, took her bowl, and went to a householder’s home. When she had arrived, the lady of the house set out a one-person bench, made her sit down, and then left and went back into the house. This bhikkhunī sat there for a moment, and without telling the owner, left the seat and went away. As she was going through the gate, a brahmin student entered that house. He looked around, didn’t see anyone, and thought: “This bench is useful for me.” Then he took it and left. The lady of the house came out, didn’t see the bhikkhunī, and also didn’t see the the one-person bench. Then she sent a message to ask the bhikkhunī: “Where is the one-person bench?” The bhikkhunī answered: “I don’t know. When I left, a brahmin student entered your house. Maybe he took it and left. You should inquire with him.” Then she went and inquired with him, and got her bench back. Then the householders were all upset and said: “This bhikkhunī knows no shame. Outwardly, she praises herself: ‘I know the true dhamma’, how is that the true dhamma? Why does she sit on an owner’s bench, and leave without telling them? There’s no difference to prostitutes and criminals.”

<lzh>諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責此比丘尼：「云何比丘尼，坐主人床座不語便捨去？」時諸比丘尼往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊爾時以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責此比丘尼：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何比丘尼，坐主人床座不語主便捨去？」時世尊以無數方便呵責此比丘尼已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，入白衣家內坐，不語主人捨去者，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked this bhikkhunī: “Why, bhikkhunī, did you sit on an owner’s seat, and leave without telling them?” Then the bhikkhunīs went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized this bhikkhunī: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why, bhikkhunī, did you sit on an owner’s seat, and leave without telling the owner?” Then, when the World-honored One had criticized this bhikkhunī in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “This bhikkhunī has all kinds of taints, and is the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī enters a lay house and sits down, and leaves without telling the owner, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼入白衣家坐，不語主人便去出門，波逸提。一脚在門內、一脚在門外，若方便欲去不去，若共期去而不去，一切突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī enters a lay house, sits down, and leaves through the gate without telling the owner, it’s a pācittiya. If she has one foot inside the gate and one foot outside, if she plans and wishes to go but doesn’t go, or if she makes an appointment to go but doesn’t go, all cases are dukkaṭas.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，語主人而去，若座上更有人坐，若去時囑比坐人而去，比坐人語言：「但去無苦。」或坐石上、木上、墼上、草敷上、若𨹃上，若屋欲崩、或火燒、若有毒蛇惡獸盜賊，若為強力所執、或被繫、或命難、或梵行難，不語主人而去，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she tells the owner and leaves, if people are still sitting on the seat, if when she leaves, she informs another person sitting there and leaves, and the other person sitting there says: “Just go, no worries,” if she sits on a stone, on a log, on a brick, on a layer of grass, or on a pile<note> Variant reading: on the hard ground.</note>, if the roof is about to collapse, if a fire is burning, if there’s a poisonous snake, a savage animal, or a criminal, if she’s held by force, if she’s arrested, if her life is in danger, or if her celibacy is in danger, and she leaves without telling the owner, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 83rd rule.)
