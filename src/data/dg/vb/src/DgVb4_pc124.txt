<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>諸比丘尼聞世尊制戒，年滿十八童女，二歲學戒，與六法，滿二十與授具足戒。時諸比丘尼，便度盲瞎癃躄、跛聾瘖瘂及餘種種病者，毀辱眾僧。</lzh>
The bhikkhunīs heard that the World-honored One had laid down a precept that an 18 year-old girl who has trained in the precepts for two years, and who has been given the six rules, may be given the full ordination when she’s 20. Then the bhikkhunīs just ordained people who were blind, infirm, crippled, lame, deaf, mute, and who had all kinds of other diseases that disgraced the sangha.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責諸比丘尼言：「世尊制戒，年十八童女，與二歲學戒，與六法，滿二十與授具足戒。汝云何乃度盲瞎及諸病者，毀辱眾僧？」時比丘尼往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責諸比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。比丘尼應十八童女，與二歲學戒，滿二十與授具足戒。汝云何乃度盲瞎及諸病人耶？」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked these bhikkhunīs: “The World-honored One has laid down a precept that an 18 year-old girl who has been given the training precepts for two years and who has been given the six rules, may be given the full ordination when she’s 20. Why did you then ordain people who are blind, … diseases that disgrace the sangha?” Then the bhikkhunīs went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha and criticized these bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. A bhikkhunī should give the training precepts to an 18 year old girl for two years, and when she’s 20 give her the full ordination. Why did you then ordain people who are blind, … diseases?” When he had criticized them in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus:

<lzh>「自今已去當與比丘尼竪立具足戒白四羯磨。當作如是與。安受戒人離聞處著見處已，是中戒師，應作白差教授師。當作如是白：『大姊僧聽！彼某甲，從和上尼某甲，求受具足戒。若僧時到僧忍聽，某甲為教授師。白如是。』彼人當往受戒人所語言：『妹！此是安陀會、此是欝多羅僧、此是僧伽梨、此是僧祇支、此是覆肩衣、此是鉢。此衣鉢是汝有不？妹聽！今是真誠時、實語時，我今問汝，實當言實、不實當言不實。汝字何等？和上字誰？年滿二十未？衣鉢具足不？父母聽汝不？夫主聽汝不？汝不負債不？汝非婢不？汝是女人不？</lzh>
“From now on, I’ll establish the full ordination for bhikkhunīs as a formal act with a motion as fourth. You should do the following to give (the ordination): Having placed the ordination candidate in a place out of earshot but within sight, the precepts master should then carry out a motion to choose an advisor. She should carry out the motion as follows: 


<h2>Saṅghakamma</h2>

‘Venerable sisters, may the sangha listen. This So-and-so requests to receive the full ordination from her preceptor So-and-so. If the right time has come for the sangha, may the sangha approve So-and-so as the advisor. This is the motion.’ 


<h2>Origin Story (continued)</h2>


That person should go to the candidate and say: ‘Younger sister, this is the lower robe, this is the upper robe, this is the saṅghāṭī, this is the vest, this is the shoulder-covering robe,<note> Other traditions have the bathing robe as the fifth robe, not the shoulder-covering robe. It’s interesting that the first four robes are transliterations and use the Indic technical terms. The fifth however is not a transliteration. This might be an indication for a later adaptation.</note> this is the bowl. Do you have these robes and the bowl or not? Younger sister, listen! Now is a time of sincerity, a time of speaking the truth. Now I’ll ask you. If something is true, you should say that it’s true. If not, you should say that it isn’t true. What’s your name? What’s your preceptor’s name? Are you 20 years old? Are your robes and bowl complete? Have your parents allowed it? Has your husband allowed it? Are you not in debt? Are you not a slavewoman? Are you a woman?

<lzh>女人有如是諸病，癩、癰疽、白癩、乾痟、瘨狂、二形、二道合、道小、常漏大小便、㖒唾常流出，汝有如此病不？』若言：『無。』當復語言：『如我向問汝事，在眾中亦當如是問，如汝向者答我，眾僧中亦當如是答。』時教授師問已，如常威儀還來入眾中，舒手相及處立，作如是白：『大姊僧聽！彼某甲，從某甲求受具足戒。若僧時到僧忍聽，我已教授竟聽使來。白如是。』彼即應語言：『汝來！』來已。教授師應為捉衣鉢，教禮尼僧足已，在戒師前，右膝著地合掌。教授師教作如是白：</lzh>
Women have the following diseases: leprosy, abscesses, mild leprosy, tuberculosis, epilepsy; are you intersex, are your anus and urinary tract joined, is your vagina small, do you often soil yourself with urine and excrement, are snot and saliva often flowing out? Do you have any of these diseases?’ If she says: ‘No’, you should continue saying: ‘As I’ve asked you about these matters, they’ll also ask you in the same way in the midst of the sangha. As you’ve answered me, in the same way you should also answer in the midst of the sangha.’ When the advisor has asked this, she should return and enter the sangha with the usual conduct, and stand within arm’s reach of the others. She should carry out a motion as follows: 


<h2>Saṅghakamma</h2>

‘Venerable sisters, may the sangha listen. This So-and-so, requests to receive the full ordination from So-and-so. If the right time has come for the sangha, may the sangha approve that I, having instructed her, allow her to come. This is the motion.’ 


<h2>Origin Story (continued)</h2>


She should then say: ‘Come!’ When (the candidate) has come, the advisor should take her robes and bowl, and having instructed her to pay respect at the bhikkhunī sangha’s feet, (the candidate) should, in front of the precepts master, place her right knee on the ground and join her palms. The advisor should instruct her to carry out a motion as follows:


<h2>Saṅghakamma</h2>

<lzh>『大姊僧聽！我某甲，從和上尼某甲，求受具足戒。我某甲今從眾僧乞受具足戒，某甲尼為和上，眾僧慈愍故，拔濟我。』如是第二、第三說。戒師應作白：『大姊僧聽！此某甲，從和上尼某甲，求受具足戒。此某甲，今從眾僧乞受具足戒，某甲尼為和上。若僧時到僧忍聽，我問諸難事。白如是。』彼當語言：『妹諦聽！今是真誠時，我今問汝，實當言實、不實當言不實。汝字何等？和上字誰？年滿二十不？衣鉢具足不？父母聽汝不？夫主聽汝不？汝不負債耶？汝非婢耶？汝是女人不？女人有如是諸病：癩、癰疽、白癩、乾痟、瘨狂、二形、二道合、道小、常漏大小便、㖒唾常流出。汝有如是病不？』若言：『無。』當作白。</lzh>
‘Venerable sisters, may the sangha listen. I, So-and-so, request to receive the full ordination from my preceptor So-and-so. I, So-and-so, now ask to receive the full ordination from the sangha with So-and-so as my preceptor. May the sangha rescue me out of compassion.’ The second and the third time should be recited likewise. 


<h2>Origin Story (continued)</h2>


The precepts master should carry out a motion: 


<h2>Saṅghakamma</h2>

‘Venerable sisters, may the sangha listen. This So-and-so requests to receive the full ordination from her preceptor So-and-so. This So-and-so now asks to receive the full ordination from the sangha with So-and-so as her preceptor. If the right time has come for the sangha, may the sangha approve that I ask her about the difficulties. This is the motion.’ 


<h2>Origin Story (continued)</h2>


She should then say: ‘Younger sister, listen carefully! Now is a time of sincerity. Now I’ll ask you. If something is true, you should say that it’s true. If not, you should say that it isn’t true. What’s your name? What’s your preceptor’s name? Are you 20 years old? Are your robes and bowl complete? Have your parents allowed it? Has your husband allowed it? Are you not in debt? Are you not a slavewoman? Are you a woman? Women have the following diseases: leprosy, abscesses, mild leprosy, tuberculosis, epilepsy; are you intersex, are your anus and urinary tract joined, is your vagina small, do you often soil yourself with urine and excrement, are snot and saliva often flowing out? Do you have any of these diseases?’ If she says: ‘No’, the motion should be carried out:


<h2>Saṅghakamma</h2>

<lzh>『大姊僧聽！此某甲，從和上尼某甲，求受具足戒。此某甲今從眾僧乞受具足戒，某甲尼為和上。某甲自說，清淨無諸難事，年滿二十衣鉢具足。若僧時到僧忍聽，授某甲具足戒，某甲尼為和上。白如是。』『大姊僧聽！此某甲，從和上尼某甲，求受具足戒。此某甲今從眾僧乞受具足戒，某甲尼為和上，某甲自說，清淨無諸難事，年滿二十，衣鉢具足。今僧授某甲具足戒，某甲尼為和上。誰諸大姊忍僧授某甲具足戒，某甲尼為和上者默然，若不忍者說。此是初羯磨。』第二、第三亦如是說。『眾僧已忍授某甲具足戒，某甲尼為和上竟，僧忍，默然故，是事如是持。』</lzh>
‘Venerable sisters, may the sangha listen. This So-and-so requests to receive the full ordination from her preceptor So-and-so. This So-and-so now asks to receive the full ordination from the sangha with So-and-so as her preceptor. So-and-so herself has said that she’s pure and without the difficulties, that she’s 20, and that her robes and bowl are complete. If the right time has come for the sangha, may the sangha approve to give So-and-so the full ordination with So-and-so as her preceptor. This is the motion.’ ‘Venerable sisters, may the sangha listen. This So-and-so requests to receive the full ordination from her preceptor So-and-so.

Those of the venerable sisters who accept that the sangha gives So-and-so the full ordination with So-and-so as her preceptor should remain silent. Those who don’t accept this should speak. This is the first announcement.’ The second and the third should be recited likewise. ‘The sangha has accepted to give So-and-so the full ordination with So-and-so as her preceptor. The sangha accepts this, therefore it’s silent. This matter is remembered thus.’

<h2>Origin Story (continued)</h2>

<lzh>「時諸比丘尼僧，應將受戒者，至比丘僧中，偏露右肩禮僧足已，右膝著地，合掌作如是語：『大德僧聽！我某甲，從和上尼某甲，求受具足戒。我某甲今從眾僧乞受具足戒，某甲尼為和上，願眾僧慈愍故，拔濟我！』第二第三亦如是說。彼當問：『汝字何等？和上字誰？乃至㖒唾常流出如上。汝已學戒清淨不？』若言：『學戒清淨。』當復更問餘比丘尼：『此人學戒清淨不？』若言：『學戒清淨。』者，彼戒師當作白：『大德僧聽！此某甲，從和上尼某甲，求受具足戒。此某甲，今從眾僧乞受具足戒，和上尼某甲。某甲已學戒清淨。若僧時到僧忍聽，僧今授某甲具足戒，某甲尼為和上，白如是。』</lzh>
Then the bhikkhunī sangha should take the candidate to the bhikkhu sangha. Having uncovered her right shoulder and paid respect at the sangha’s feet, she should place her right knee on the ground, join her palms, and say: 


<h2>Saṅghakamma</h2>

‘Venerables, may the sangha listen. I, So-and-so, request to receive the full ordination from my preceptor So-and-so. I, So-and-so, now ask to receive the full ordination from the sangha with So-and-so as my preceptor. May the sangha rescue me out of compassion.’ The second and the third time should be recited likewise. 


<h2>Origin Story (continued)</h2>


They should ask: ‘What’s your name? What’s your preceptor’s name? … are snot and saliva often flowing out? Have you trained in the precepts, and are you pure?’ If she says: ‘I’ve trained in the precepts and am pure’, they should also ask the other bhikkhunīs: ‘Has this person trained in the precepts and is pure?’ If they say: ‘She has trained in the precepts and is pure’, the precepts master should carry out the motion: 


<h2>Saṅghakamma</h2>

‘Venerables, may the sangha listen. This So-and-so requests to receive the full ordination from her preceptor So-and-so. This So-and-so now asks to receive the full ordination from the sangha with So-and-so as her preceptor. So-and-so has trained in the precepts and is pure. If the right time has come for the sangha, may the sangha approve that the sangha now gives So-and-so the full ordination with So-and-so as her preceptor. This is the motion.’ 

<lzh>『大德僧聽！此某甲，從和上尼某甲，求受具足戒。此某甲，今從眾僧乞受具足戒，某甲尼為和上。某甲已學戒清淨。今僧授某甲具足戒，某甲尼為和上。誰諸長老忍僧授某甲具足戒，某甲尼為和上者默然，誰不忍者說。此初羯磨。』第二、第三亦如是說。『眾僧已忍與某甲授具足戒，某甲尼為和上竟，僧忍，默然故，是事如是持。』</lzh>

<h2>Origin Story (continued)</h2>

<lzh>『族姓女聽！此是如來、無所著、等正覺說八波羅夷法，犯者非比丘尼、非釋種女。不得作不淨行、行婬欲法。若比丘尼，意樂作不淨行、行婬欲法，乃至共畜生，此非比丘尼、非釋種女。汝是中盡形壽不得犯。能持不？能者當言：「能。」』</lzh>
‘Clanswoman, listen! These are the eight pārājika rules spoken by the Tathāgata, without attachment and fully awakened. One who commits them is not a bhikkhunī, not a Sakyan daughter. You may not commit impure practices and engage in sexual intercourse. If a bhikkhunī willingly commits impure practices and engages in sexual intercourse, even together with an animal, she’s not a bhikkhunī, not a Sakyan daughter. You therefore may not commit this for your whole life. Can you keep it?’ One who can should say: ‘I can.’ 

<lzh>『不得盜乃至草葉。若比丘尼，偷人五錢若過五錢，若自取、教人取，若自斷、教人斷，若自破、教人破、若燒、若埋、若壞色，彼非比丘尼、非釋種女。汝是中盡形壽不得犯。能持不？能者當言：「能。」』</lzh>
‘You may not steal even grass and leaves. If a bhikkhunī steals from someone (something worth) five coins or more than five coins, whether she takes it herself or instructs others to take it, or whether she cuts it off herself or instructs others to cut it off, or whether she breaks it herself or instructs others to break it, or if she burns it, buries it, or damages the color, she’s not a bhikkhunī, not a Sakyan daughter. You therefore may not commit this for your whole life. Can you keep it?’ One who can should say: ‘I can.’ 

<lzh>『不得故斷眾生命乃至蟻子。若比丘尼，故自手斷人命，若持刀與人，教死、讚死、勸死，若與非藥，若墮人胎、𥜒禱、呪詛殺，若自作、若教人作，彼非比丘尼、非釋種女。汝是中盡形壽不得犯。能持不？能者當言：「能。」』</lzh>
‘You may not intentionally take the life of living beings, even ants. If a bhikkhunī intentionally and with her own hand takes the life of a human being, or gives a knife to someone, or teaches, praises and recommends death, or gives fake medicines, or causes an abortion, or kills someone with a curse of black magic, whether she does it herself or instructs others to do it, she’s not a bhikkhunī, not a Sakyan daughter. You therefore may not commit this for your whole life. Can you keep it?’ One who can should say: ‘I can.’ 

<lzh>『不得妄語乃至戲笑。若比丘尼，不真實非己有，自稱言我得上人法，我得禪得解脫、得三昧正受、得須陀洹果、斯陀含果、阿那含果、阿羅漢果，天來、龍來、鬼神來供養我，此非比丘尼、非釋種女。汝是中盡形壽不得作。能持不？能者當言：「能。」』</lzh>
‘You may not lie, even as a joke. If a bhikkhunī untruthfully praises herself when she doesn’t have (these attainments): “I’ve attained a superhuman state, I’ve attained jhānas, liberation, the mental unity of samādhi, the fruit of stream-entry, of once-return, of non-return, and of arahantship, and the gods, dragons, and spirits came to make offerings to me,” she’s not a bhikkhunī, not a Sakyan daughter. You therefore may not commit this for your whole life. Can you keep it?’ One who can should say: ‘I can.’

<lzh>『不得身相觸乃至共畜生。若比丘尼，有染污心，與染污心男子身相觸，從腋已下、膝已上身相觸，若捉、若摩、若牽、若推、逆摩、順摩、若舉、若下、若捉、若捺，非比丘尼非釋種女。汝是中盡形壽不得犯。能持不？能者當言：「能。」』</lzh>
‘You may not come in bodily contact, even with an animal. If a bhikkhunī with a defiled mind comes in bodily contact with a man with a defiled mind, and if they’ve their bodies touch each other below the armpits and above the knees; if they grasp<note> I translate 若捉、若摩 as one word, in line with pārājika 5: 若捉摩. Otherwise 若捉 would occur twice in this list.</note>, pull, push, rub upwards and downwards, lift up, set down, hold, and press each other, she’s not a bhikkhunī, not a Sakyan daughter. You therefore may not commit this for your whole life. Can you keep it?’ One who can should say: ‘I can.’

<lzh>『不得犯八事，乃至共畜生。若比丘尼染污心，受染污心男子捉手、捉衣，入屏處、屏處共立、共語、共行、身相近、共期，犯此八事，彼非比丘尼、非釋種女，犯八事故。汝是中盡形壽不得犯。能持不？能者當言：「能。」』</lzh>
‘You may not commit the eight things, even with an animal. If a bhikkhunī with a defiled mind lets a man with a defiled mind hold her hand and hold her robes, and they enter a secluded place, and in the secluded place they stand together, talk together, walk together, bring their bodies close to each other, and make appointments, committing these eight things, she’s not a bhikkhunī, not a Sakyan daughter because she committed the eight things. You therefore may not commit this for your whole life. Can you keep it?’ One who can should say: ‘I can.’

<lzh>『不得覆藏他罪，乃至突吉羅惡說。若比丘尼，知他比丘尼犯波羅夷罪，若不自舉、不白僧、若眾多人，後於異時，此比丘尼，若罷道、若滅擯、若遮不共僧事、若入外道，後便作是說：「我先知有如是如是事。」彼非比丘尼非釋種女，覆重罪故。汝是中盡形壽不得作。能持不？能者當言：「能。」』</lzh>
‘You may not conceal another’s offenses, even dukkaṭas and bad speech. If a bhikkhunī knows that another bhikkhunī has committed a pārājika offense and neither charges her herself, nor informs the sangha or a group, but if at a later time after that bhikkhunī has either disrobed, or been permanently expelled, or been barred from conducting sangha matters with the others, or has joined a non-Buddhist group, she should say: “I previously already knew that there was such-and-such a matter,” she’s not a bhikkhunī, not a Sakyan daughter because she concealed a heavy offense. You therefore may not do this for your whole life. Can you keep it?’ One who can should say: ‘I can.’

<lzh>『不得隨順被舉比丘語，乃至守園人及沙彌。若比丘尼，知比丘為僧所舉，如法如律、如佛所教，不隨順、不懺悔，僧未與作共住而隨順。是比丘尼諫彼比丘尼言：「汝妹知不？今僧舉此比丘，如法如律、如佛所教，不隨順、不懺悔，僧未與作共住，汝莫隨順。」是比丘尼諫彼比丘尼時堅持不捨，是比丘尼當三諫，捨此事故。乃至三諫捨者善；不捨者，彼非比丘尼非釋種女，由隨舉故。汝是中盡形壽不得犯。能持不？能者當言：「能。」』</lzh>
‘You may not follow what a suspended bhikkhu says, not even a monastery attendant or a sāmaṇera. If a bhikkhunī knows that a bhikkhu has been suspended by the sangha according to dhamma and vinaya, according to the Buddha’s teaching, but that he doesn’t comply, doesn’t repent, and that the sangha hasn’t yet allowed him back to live with the community again, and she still follows him, the bhikkhunīs should admonish that bhikkhunī: “Younger sister, do you know that the sangha has now suspended this bhikkhu, according to dhamma and vinaya, according to the Buddha’s teaching, but he doesn’t comply, doesn’t repent, and the sangha hasn’t yet allowed him back to live with the community again? Don’t follow him.” If when the bhikkhunīs admonish that bhikkhunī, she holds firmly on to it and doesn’t give it up, the bhikkhunīs should admonish her three times to give up this matter. If she gives it up by the third admonishment, it’s fine. If not, she’s not a bhikkhunī, not a Sakyan daughter because she followed a suspended one. You therefore may not commit this for your whole life. Can you keep it?’ One who can should say: ‘I can.’

<lzh>『族姓女聽！如來、無所著、等正覺說四依法，比丘尼依此得出家受具足戒成比丘尼。依糞掃衣，得出家受具足戒成比丘尼法。汝是中盡形壽能持不？能者當言：「能。」』『若得長利，檀越施衣、割壞衣得受。』</lzh>
‘Clanswoman, listen! The Tathāgata, without attachment and fully awakened has spoken of four supports. A bhikkhunī relying on these may go forth, receive the full ordination, and become a bhikkhunī. Relying on rag robes, one may go forth, receive the full ordination, and become a bhikkhunī. Can you therefore keep this for your whole life?’ One who can should say: ‘I can.’ ‘If you obtain extra requisites and supporters offer you robes, if the cloth is cut and stained, you may accept it.’

Relying on almsfood, one may go forth, receive the full ordination, and accomplish becoming a bhikkhunī. Can you therefore keep this for your whole life?’ One who can should say: ‘I can.’ ‘If you obtain extra requisites and the sangha sends food or supporters send food, or if there’s a meal on the eighth, the fourteenth, and the fifteenth day of the month, or on the first day of the month, or if there’s a permanent meal for the sangha, or if supporters invite you for a meal, you should accept it.’

Relying on sitting under a tree, one may go forth, receive the full ordination, and accomplish becoming a bhikkhunī. Can you therefore keep this for your whole life?’ One who can should say: ‘I can.’ ‘If you obtain extra requisites, a separate building, a house with a pointed roof, a small building, a stone house, or two rooms with a common door, you should accept it.’

<lzh>『依腐爛藥，得出家受具足戒成比丘尼法。汝是中盡形壽能持不？能者當言：「能。」』『若得長利，酥油、生酥、蜜、石蜜應受。』</lzh>
Relying on fermented urine as medicine, one may go forth, receive the full ordination, and accomplish becoming a bhikkhunī. Can you therefore keep this for your whole life?’ One who can should say: ‘I can.’ ‘If you obtain extra requisites, ghee, oil, butter, honey, and sugar, you should accept them.’

<lzh>『汝已受具足戒白四羯磨如法成就得處所，和上如法、阿闍梨如法、二部僧如法具足滿，汝當善受教法，應勸化作福治塔供養眾僧。若和上阿闍梨一切如法教授不得違逆，應學問誦經懃求方便，於佛法中得須陀洹果、斯陀含果、阿那含果、阿羅漢果，汝始發心出家功不唐捐、果報不絕。餘所未知，當問和上阿闍梨。』令受戒人在前、餘尼在後而去。</lzh>
You’ve received the full ordination in a formal act with a motion as fourth according to dhamma. You’ve successfully obtained your place, with a preceptor according to dhamma, with a teacher according to dhamma, and both sanghas have fully ordained you according to dhamma. You should receive good teachings in the dhamma and encourage others to make merit, look after stupas, and support the sangha. If your preceptor and teachers all instruct you according to dhamma, you may not disobey them. You should learn knowledge, recite suttas, and strive with skillful means to attain the fruit of stream-entry, once-return, non-return, and arahantship in the Buddha’s dhamma. You should mentally determine to make your going-forth successful, not to waste it, with enduring results. As for other things that you don’t know yet, you should ask your preceptor and teachers.’ They leave with the candidate in front and the other bhikkhunīs behind.

<lzh>自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，年十八童女，與二歲學戒，與六法，滿二十，眾僧不聽便與授具足戒者，波逸提。」</lzh>
From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī gives the training precepts to an 18 year old girl for two years and gives her the six rules, and when she’s 20, without the sangha’s approval, just gives her the full ordination, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above. 

<lzh>僧者如上。</lzh>
“Sangha” is as above.

<lzh>若比丘尼，年滿二十，二歲學戒，與六法，眾僧不聽，與授具足戒，三羯磨竟，和上尼，波逸提。白二羯磨，三突吉羅。白一羯磨，二突吉羅。白已，一突吉羅。白未竟，突吉羅。未白前集眾眾滿，一切突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī, without the sangha’s approval, gives the full ordination to a 20 year old who has trained in the precepts for two years, and has been given the six rules, when they’ve carried out the three announcements, the preceptor commits a pācittiya. When they’ve carried out the motion and two announcements, it’s three dukkaṭas. When they’ve carried out the motion and one announcement, it’s two dukkaṭas. When they’ve carried out the motion, it’s one dukkaṭa. If the motion hasn’t yet been finished, it’s a dukkaṭa. If they haven’t yet done the motion, when they gather the sangha, or when the assembly is complete, in all cases it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，年滿二十，二歲學戒，眾僧聽受具足戒，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if a 20 year old, who has trained in the precepts for two years and whom the sangha has approved, receives the full ordination, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 124th rule.)

<lzh>(二十四)</lzh>
