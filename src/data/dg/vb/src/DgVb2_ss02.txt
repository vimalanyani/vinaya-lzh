<lzh>爾時世尊在羅閱城耆闍崛山中。時世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，告諸比丘：「自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼㥲恚不喜，以無根波羅夷法謗，欲破彼清淨行。後於異時，若問、若不問，知是事無根，說我㥲恚故如是語。是比丘尼犯初法應捨，僧伽婆尸沙。」(二竟)</lzh>

<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī, angry and dissatisfied, slanders someone with an unfounded pārājika offense, wishing to destroy her monastic life, and at a later time, whether questioned or not questioned, it becomes known that that matter is unfounded, and she says: “Because I was angry, I said that,” that bhikkhunī commits an immediate offense that should be given up, a saṅghādisesa.’” (End of the second rule.)
