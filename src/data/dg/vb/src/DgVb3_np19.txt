<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。時偷羅難陀比丘尼有檀越，晨朝著衣持鉢詣其家語言：「我須酥。」彼言：「可爾。」即買與之。既買酥與，而言：「我不須酥，須油。」彼言：「可得。」彼即往賣酥家語言：「我不須酥，須油。」其人報言：「當作買酥法取汝酥，當作賣油法與汝油。」彼檀越即譏嫌言：「比丘尼無有厭足、不知慚愧，外自稱言：『我知正法。』求酥索油、求油索酥。如是何有正法？若須酥直應索酥，須油便應索油，若須餘物便應索餘物。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park. Then, Thullanandā bhikkhunī had a supporter. In the morning, she put on her robes, took her bowl, went to their house, and said: “I need ghee.” They said: “Okay.” Then they bought and gave it. When they had already bought and given ghee, she said: “I don’t need ghee, I need oil.” They said: “You’ll get it.” Then they went to the ghee seller and said: “We don’t need ghee, we need oil.” The (seller) replied: “I’ll take your ghee under the conditions for purchasing ghee<note> i.e. at wholesale price</note> and I’ll give you oil under the conditions for selling oil.<note> i.e. at retail price</note>” The supporter then was upset and said: “The bhikkhunīs have no moderation and they know no shame. Outwardly, they praise themselves: ‘We know the true dhamma’, but when wanting ghee, they ask for oil, when wanting oil, they ask for ghee. How is that the true dhamma? If you need ghee, you should directly ask for ghee, if you need oil, you should directly ask for oil, if you need other things, you should directly ask for other things.”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，呵責偷羅難陀比丘尼言：「云何索酥求油、索油求酥？」時諸比丘尼白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊爾時以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責偷羅難陀比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。汝云何求酥索油、求油索酥？」時世尊以無數方便呵責偷羅難陀比丘尼已，告諸比丘：「此偷羅難陀比丘尼！多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼欲索是更索彼者，尼薩耆波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They criticized Thullanandā bhikkhunī: “Why did you ask for ghee when you wanted oil, and ask for oil when you wanted ghee?” Then the bhikkhunīs told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized Thullanandā bhikkhunī: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you, wanting ghee, ask for oil, and wanting oil, ask for ghee?” Then, when the World-honored One had criticized Thullanandā bhikkhunī in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “This Thullanandā bhikkhunī has all kinds of taints, and is the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī wants and asks for something, and then still asks for something else, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>欲索是更索彼者，求酥已更求油，索油已更索酥。若求餘物亦如是。</lzh>
“Wanting and asking for something, and then still asking for something else” means having wanted ghee, then still wanting oil, or having asked for oil, then still asking for ghee. If she wants other things, it’s also the same.

<lzh>若比丘尼欲索是，更索彼者，尼薩耆波逸提。此尼薩耆應捨與尼僧、若眾多人、若一人，不得別眾捨，若捨不成捨，突吉羅。若欲捨時，應往僧中偏露右肩、脫革屣、禮僧足已，右膝著地、合掌作如是言：「大姊僧聽！我某甲比丘尼索是更索彼，犯捨墮，今捨與僧。」捨已應懺悔。前受懺人白已然後受懺，作如是白：「大姊僧聽！此某甲比丘尼索是更索彼，犯捨墮，今捨與僧。若僧時到僧忍聽，我受某甲比丘尼懺。白如是。」應如是白已受彼懺，語彼言：</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī wants and asks for something, and still asks for something else, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. This nissaggiya should be relinquished to the bhikkhunī sangha, or to a group of people, or to a single person. One may not relinquish it to a divided assembly. If she relinquishes it (to them), the relinquishing isn’t accomplished, and it’s a dukkaṭa. When she wants to relinquish it, she should go into the midst of the sangha, uncover her right shoulder, take off her leather sandals, and having paid respect at the sangha’s feet, place her right knee on the ground, join her palms, and say: 


<h2>Saṅghakamma</h2>

<lzh>“</lzh>
Venerable sisters, may the sangha listen. I, bhikkhunī So-and-so, have asked for something and still asked for something else. I’ve committed a nissaggiya pācittiya. Now I relinquish it to the sangha.” 


<h2>Explanation (continued)</h2>


When she has relinquished it, she should confess. First the person who receives the confession (carries out) the motion, and then receives the confession. She carries out the motion as follows: 


<h2>Saṅghakamma</h2>

<lzh>“</lzh>
Venerable sisters, may the sangha listen. This bhikkhunī So-and-so has asked for something and still asked for something else. She has committed a nissaggiya pācittiya. Now she has relinquished it to the sangha. If the right time has come for the sangha, may the sangha approve that I receive bhikkhunī So-and-so’s confession. This is the motion.” 


<h2>Explanation (continued)</h2>


When she has done the motion like this, she should receive her confession and tell her: 

<lzh>「自責汝心！」答言：「爾。」比丘尼僧即應還彼比丘尼捨物，白二羯磨應如是與。僧中應差堪能羯磨者如上，當如是白：「大姊僧聽！此某甲比丘尼索是更索彼，犯捨墮，今捨與僧。若僧時到僧忍聽，持此捨物還某甲比丘尼。白如是。」「大姊僧聽！此某甲比丘尼索是更索彼，犯捨墮，今捨與僧。僧持此捨物還某甲比丘尼。誰諸大姊忍僧還某甲比丘尼捨物者默然，誰不忍者說。」「僧已忍還某甲比丘尼捨物竟，僧忍，默然故，是事如是持。」</lzh>
“Correct your mind!” She answers: “Yes.” The bhikkhunī sangha should then return the relinquished item to that bhikkhunī, and a formal act with a motion as second should be carried out as follows: In the sangha, they should choose a capable person who can carry out formal acts as above. She should carry out the motion as follows: 


<h2>Saṅghakamma</h2>

<lzh>“</lzh>
Venerable sisters, may the sangha listen. This bhikkhunī So-and-so has asked for something and still asked for something else. She has committed a nissaggiya pācittiya. Now she has relinquished it to the sangha. If the right time has come for the sangha, may the sangha approve that this relinquished item be returned to bhikkhunī So-and-so. This is the motion.” “Venerable sisters, may the sangha listen. This bhikkhunī So-and-so has asked for something and still asked for something else. She has committed a nissaggiya pācittiya. Now she has relinquished it to the sangha. The sangha returns this relinquished item to bhikkhunī So-and-so. Those of the venerable sisters who accept that the sangha returns the relinquished item to bhikkhunī So-and-so should remain silent. Those who don’t accept this should speak.” “The sangha has accepted to return the relinquished item to bhikkhunī So-and-so. The sangha accepts this, therefore you’re silent. This matter is remembered thus.”


<h2>Explanation (continued)</h2>

<lzh>捨物竟不還者，突吉羅。若還時有人教言莫還者，突吉羅。若不還轉作淨施、若遣與人、若故壞、若燒、若作非物、若數數用、一切突吉羅。</lzh>
If, after she has relinquished the item, they don’t return it, it’s a dukkaṭa. If when they return it, someone instructs them: “Don’t return it”, it’s a dukkaṭa (for that person). If they don’t return it and turn it into a pure offering<note> vikappana</note>, if they send it to someone else, if they intentionally damage it, if they burn it, if they turn it into another item, or if they frequently use it, in all cases it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，若須酥索酥、若須油索油、若須餘物便索餘物、若從親里索、從出家人索、若為彼彼為己索、若不求而得，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she needs ghee and asks for ghee, if she needs oil and asks for oil, if she needs other things and directly asks for other things, if she asks from relatives, if she asks from renunciates, if she asks for others and others ask for her, and if she obtains it without asking, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。(十九竟)</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 19th rule.)
