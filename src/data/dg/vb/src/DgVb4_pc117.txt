<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時有六群比丘尼，誦種種雜呪術、或支節呪、或剎利呪、鬼呪、吉凶呪，或習轉鹿輪卜、或習解知音聲。</lzh>
Then the group-of-six bhikkhunīs recited various kinds of magic arts: the magic of body parts, the magic of governing, the magic of ghosts, and the magic of fortune and misfortune, and they learned divination by turning the zodiac, and they learned to understand sounds.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，呵責六群比丘尼言：「汝云何習誦如是種種支節呪，乃至解諸音聲呪？」呵責已往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白佛。佛以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責六群比丘尼：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何誦習種種呪術，乃至解知音聲耶？」呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼誦習世俗呪術者，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “Why did you learn and recite these various kinds of magic: the magic of body parts, … the magic of understanding sounds?” Having criticized them, they went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the Buddha. The Buddha for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha and criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you recite and learn various kinds of magic arts: … understanding sounds?” Having criticized them, he said to the bhikkhus: “These bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī recites and learns worldly magic arts, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>世俗呪術者，支節乃至解知音聲也。</lzh>
“Worldly magic arts” means body parts, … understanding sounds. 

<lzh>比丘尼誦習世俗呪術乃至音聲，若口受、若執文誦，說而了了，波逸提；不了了，突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī recites and learns worldly magic arts: … understanding sounds, whether she has learned it orally or takes up a text and recites it from there, if she speaks and others understand, it’s a pācittiya. If others don’t understand, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，若誦治腹內虫病呪、若誦治宿食不消呪、若學書、若誦世俗降伏外道呪、若誦治毒呪以護身故，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she recites a spell to cure an illness of bugs inside the stomach, if she recites a spell so that food stored overnight doesn’t spoil, if she learns to write, if she recites a worldly spell to defeat non-Buddhist renunciates, if she recites a spell to remove poison in order to protect her body, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 117th rule.)
