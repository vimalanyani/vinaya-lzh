<h2>First Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時舍衛城中有一多知識比丘尼命終，時諸比丘尼在比丘僧伽藍中立塔，彼處處取大僧洗足石破用壘塔。有客比丘來，不知是比丘尼塔，便向禮拜。</lzh>
Then, a very wise bhikkhunī passed away in Sāvatthī. The bhikkhunīs set up a stupa in a bhikkhu monastery. They took the bhikkhu sangha’s foot-washing stones from everywhere, broke them, and used them to build the stupa. Visiting bhikkhus came, didn’t know that this was a bhikkhunī’s stupa, and paid respect to it.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，呵責諸比丘尼言：「云何乃在大僧僧伽藍中立塔，令客比丘來不知而禮拜耶？」即白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責諸比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何比丘尼，乃於大僧僧伽藍中立塔，令客比丘不知而向禮拜？」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，在比丘僧伽藍內起塔者，波逸提。」如是世尊與比丘尼結戒。</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They criticized these bhikkhunīs: “Why did you set up a stupa in a bhikkhu monastery? Visiting bhikkhus came, didn’t know, and paid respect.” Then they told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha and criticized these bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why, bhikkhunīs, did you set up a stupa in a bhikkhu monastery? Visiting bhikkhus didn’t know, and paid respect to it.” When he had criticized them in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>First Preliminary Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī builds a stupa in a bhikkhu monastery, it’s a pācittiya.’” In this way the World-honored One laid down the precept for the bhikkhunīs.


<h2>Second Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>時諸比丘尼，在故壞無比丘僧伽藍中起塔疑。佛言：「無犯。自今已去當如是結戒：若比丘尼，在有比丘僧伽藍內起塔，波逸提。」</lzh>
Then the bhikkhunīs build a stupa in an old, dilapidated monastery without bhikkhus. They had doubts. The Buddha said: “There’s no offense. From now on, you should recite the precept like this: 


<h2>Second Preliminary Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī builds a stupa in a monastery where there are bhikkhus, it’s a pācittiya.’” 


<h2>Third Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>彼比丘尼，不知有比丘無比丘，後乃知，或作波逸提懺者或有疑者。佛言：「不知，無犯。自今已去應如是結戒：若比丘尼，知有比丘僧伽藍中起塔，波逸提。」</lzh>
The bhikkhunīs didn’t know whether there were bhikkhus or not, and they only found out later. Some confessed a pācittiya. Some had doubts. The Buddha said: “If you don’t know, there’s no offense. From now on, you should recite the precept like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī knows that there are bhikkhus in a monastery and builds a stupa, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>若比丘尼，知有比丘僧伽藍中起塔，隨所取洗足石，若團埿若草團多少，一一波逸提。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī knows that there are bhikkhus in a monastery and builds a stupa, whenever she takes a foot-washing stone, or a lump of mud, or a bundle of grass, however much, each is a pācittiya.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，若先不知，若故壞僧伽藍，若先起塔後作僧伽藍，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she doesn’t know at first, if it’s in an old, dilapidated monastery, or if she first builds a stupa and it later becomes a monastery, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 174th rule.)
