<h2>First Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時有一長者共婦出家為道，食時詣村乞食，得已持還尼僧伽藍中。食時本婦比丘尼持水在前立，并以扇扇。比丘語言：「小避去！我羞人，莫在我前立。」比丘尼語言：「大德何以羞我？」彼復言：「何不速去！我羞。」比丘尼答言：「我在前立便言可羞，本來作如是如是事何以不羞？」其婦比丘尼㥲恚，以扇柄打、以水澆頭而捨入房。</lzh>
Then there was a householder who went forth to practise the path together with this wife. At mealtime, they went to the village on almsround. Having obtained (some food), they took it and returned to the bhikkhunī monastery. During the meal, the bhikkhunī who was the former wife took water and stood in front of him, and also fanned him with a fan. The bhikkhu said: “Move away a little. I’m a person possessed of shame. Don’t stand in front of me.” The bhikkhunī said: “Venerable, why are you ashamed of me?” He said again: “Why don’t you leave quickly? I’m ashamed.” The bhikkhunī answered: “When I stand in front of you, you say it’s shameful. Previously, we did certain things together, how come you weren’t ashamed then?” And the bhikkhunī, his wife, angrily hit him with the handle of the fan, poured the water on his head, left him, and entered her room.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責此比丘尼：「汝云何瞋恚打比丘？」時諸比丘尼往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責此比丘尼：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何比丘尼打比丘？」時世尊以無數方便呵責此比丘尼已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，比丘食時供給水、以扇扇者，波逸提。」如是世尊與比丘尼結戒。</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked this bhikkhunī: “Why did you angrily hit a bhikkhu?” Then the bhikkhunīs went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized this bhikkhunī: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you, bhikkhunī, hit a bhikkhu?” Then, when the World-honored One had criticized this bhikkhunī in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “This bhikkhunī has all kinds of taints, and is the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Preliminary Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī, when a bhikkhu is eating, offers him water or fans him with a fan, it’s a pācittiya.’” In this way, the World-honored One laid down the precept for the bhikkhunīs.


<h2>Second Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>時諸比丘尼疑，不敢瞻視病比丘，無人與水不敢問。佛言：「聽諸比丘尼看病比丘，若無水聽問。自今已去應如是結戒：若比丘尼，比丘無病，食時供給水、以扇扇者，波逸提。」</lzh>
Then the bhikkhunīs had doubts and didn’t dare to look after sick bhikkhus. Nobody gave them water, and they didn’t dare ask. The Buddha said: “I allow the bhikkhunīs to look after a sick bhikkhu, and if he has no water, I allow to ask. From now on, you should recite the precept like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī, when a bhikkhu isn’t sick and is eating, offers him water or fans him with a fan, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>若彼比丘尼，比丘不病，食時供給水、在前立以扇扇者，波逸提。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī, when a bhikkhu isn’t sick and is eating, offers him water, or stands in front and fans him with a fan, it’s a pācittiya.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，瞻視病比丘無水問，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she looks after a sick bhikkhu who has no water and asks, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 75th rule.)
