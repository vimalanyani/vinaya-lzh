<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時跋難陀釋子有二沙彌：一名耳、二名蜜，一人休道，一人著袈裟入外道眾中。時六群比丘尼以沙門衣，施與休道者及與彼入外道者。</lzh>
Then Upananda the Sakyan had two sāmaṇeras, one called “Ear” and the other called “Honey”. One of them disrobed and the other joined a group of non-Buddhist renunciates while wearing the monastic robe. Then the group-of-six bhikkhunīs offered renunciates’ robes to the one who had disrobed and the other who had joined non-Buddhist renunciates. 

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，呵責六群比丘尼：「汝云何持沙門衣，施與休道者及與彼入外道者？」諸比丘尼往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白佛。佛以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責六群比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何汝等以沙門衣與彼休道及入外道者？」爾時世尊以無數方便呵責六群比丘尼已，告諸比丘：「此諸比丘尼，多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼持沙門衣施與外道白衣者，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “Why did you take renunciates’ robes and offer them to someone who had disrobed and to someone who had joined non-Buddhist renunciates?” The bhikkhunīs went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the Buddha. The Buddha for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha and criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you give renunciates’ robes to someone who had disrobed and to someone who had joined non-Buddhist renunciates?” Then, when the World-honored One had criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī takes a renunciate’s robe and offers it to non-Buddhist renunciates or lay people, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>白衣者，在家人。</lzh>
“Lay people” means householders.

<lzh>外道者，在佛法外出家人。</lzh>
“Non-Buddhist renunciates” means people gone forth outside the Buddha’s dhamma.

<lzh>沙門衣者，染曬衣。</lzh>
“A renunciate’s robe” means a dyed and sun-dried robe.

<lzh>彼比丘尼以沙門衣施與彼受者，波逸提。此與彼不受，突吉羅。方便欲與而不與，期要當與而不與，一切突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī offers a renunciate’s robe and someone else accepts it, it’s a pācittiya. If she offers and the other doesn’t accept it, it’s a dukkaṭa. If she plans and want to give, but doesn’t give, or if she promises that she’ll give, but doesn’t give, in all cases it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，若與父母，若與塔作人，與講堂屋舍作人計挍食直與，或為強力者所奪，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she gives it to her parents, if she gives it to people building a stupa, a dhamma hall, or a building, if she calculates the value of food and gives it, or if it’s snatched by force, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 107th rule.)
