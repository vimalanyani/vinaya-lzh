<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>爾時世尊聽比丘尼作浴衣。時六群比丘尼聞世尊聽比丘尼作浴衣，便多作廣大浴衣。時比丘尼見已問言：「佛聽諸比丘尼畜五衣。此是何衣？」報言：「此是我等浴衣。」</lzh>
Then the World-honored One had allowed the bhikkhunīs to make a bathing robe. When the group-of-six bhikkhunīs heard that the World-honored One had allowed the bhikkhunīs to make a bathing robe, they made overly broad and large bathing robes. When the bhikkhunīs saw it, they asked: “The Buddha has allowed the bhikkhunīs to keep five robes. Which robes are these?” They replied: “These are our bathing robes.”

<lzh>諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責六群比丘尼言：「世尊聽畜浴衣。云何便多廣大作浴衣耶？」時諸比丘尼白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責六群比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何比丘尼多作廣大浴衣耶？」時世尊以無數方便呵責六群比丘尼已，告諸比丘言：「此六群比丘尼！多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，作浴衣應量作。應量作者，長佛六磔手、廣二磔手半，若過者波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “The World-honored One has allowed to keep five robes. Why did you make overly broad and large bathing robes?” Then the bhikkhunīs told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why, bhikkhunīs, did you make overly broad and large bathing robes?” When the World-honored One had criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These group-of-six bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī makes a bathing robe, she should make it to the measurements. “Should make it to the measurements” means six handspans of the Buddha in length, two and a half handspans in width. If she exceeds that, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>浴衣者，障身浴也。</lzh>
“A bathing robe” means to conceal the body when bathing.

<lzh>彼比丘尼作浴衣，長中過量、廣中足，長中足、廣中過量，若二俱過量，自割截作成者，波逸提；不成者，突吉羅。若語他作割截，成者波逸提；不成者，突吉羅。若為他作，成不成，一切突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī makes a bathing robe, and the length exceeds the measurements but the width is acceptable, or the length is acceptable but the width exceeds the measurements, or both exceed the measurements, and if she cuts and finishes it herself, it’s a pācittiya. If she doesn’t finish it, it’s a dukkaṭa. If she tells others to cut it, and they finish it, it’s a pācittiya. If they don’t finish it, it’s a dukkaṭa. If she makes it for someone else, whether she finishes it or not, in all cases it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，波逸提；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a pācittiya. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，如量作減量作，若得已成者，當裁令如法，若重疊，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she makes it to the measurements, or if she makes it smaller; if she obtains it ready-made, she should cut it to make it according to the rule; or if she folds it, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 102nd rule.)
