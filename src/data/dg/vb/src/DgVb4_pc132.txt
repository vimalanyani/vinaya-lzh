<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時世尊在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the World-honored One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼，聞世尊制戒聽年十二歲得授人具足戒，皆自稱言：「年滿十二歲。」愚癡輒授人具足戒，不知教授。以不被教授故，不按威儀，著衣不齊整、乞食不如法、處處受不淨食、或受不淨鉢食、在小食大食上高聲大喚，如婆羅門聚會法。</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard that the World-honored One had laid down a precept and allowed people with 12 vassa to give the full ordination to someone, they all praised themselves: “I’ve 12 vassa.” Ignorant ones gave the full ordination to people and didn’t know how to instruct them. Because (the new bhikkhunīs) weren’t instructed, they weren’t established in proper conduct, didn’t wear their robes neatly, did their almsround not according to dhamma, accepted improper food here and there, or accepted food in improper bowls, and shouted loudly during breakfast and lunch like at a gathering of brahmins.

<lzh>諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責此諸比丘尼：「汝等聞世尊制戒年十二歲得授人具足戒，而汝云何自稱年滿十二，求授人具足戒，癡不知教授。彼以不被教授故，不按威儀，著衣不齊整、乞食不如法，乃至如婆羅門聚會法？」時諸比丘尼往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責此諸比丘尼：</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked these bhikkhunīs: “When you heard that the World-honored One had laid down a precept that people with 12 vassa may give the full ordination to someone, why did you praise yourselves for having 12 vassa and ask for the Giving-of-full-ordination, when you’re foolish and don’t know how to instruct? Because (the new bhikkhunīs) weren’t instructed, they weren’t established in proper conduct, didn’t wear their robes neatly, did their almsround not according to dhamma, … like at a gathering of brahmins.” Then the bhikkhunīs went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha and criticized these bhikkhunīs: 

<lzh>「汝等所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。汝等云何自稱言滿十二歲，求授人具足戒，癡不知教授。彼以不被教授故，不按威儀，著衣不齊整、乞食不如法，乃至如婆羅門聚會法？」時世尊以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此諸比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼年滿十二歲，眾僧不聽，便授人具足戒者，波逸提。」</lzh>
“What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you praise yourselves for having 12 vassa and ask for the Giving-of-full-ordination, when you’re foolish and don’t know how to instruct? Because (the new bhikkhunīs) weren’t instructed, they weren’t established in proper conduct, didn’t wear their robes neatly, did their almsround not according to dhamma, … like at a gathering of brahmins.” When the World-honored One had criticized them in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī, who has 12 vassa, gives the full ordination to someone without the sangha’s approval, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼，年滿十二歲，眾僧不聽，授人具足戒者，波逸提。眾僧不聽，授依止及畜式叉摩那、沙彌尼，一切突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī, who has 12 vassa, gives the full ordination to someone without the sangha’s approval, it’s a pācittiya. If she gives dependence, or takes on a sikkhamānā or a sāmaṇerī, without the sangha’s approval, in all cases it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，年滿十二、眾僧聽授人具足戒，及與人依止，畜式叉摩那、沙彌尼，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she has 12 vassa and with the sangha’s approval, gives the full ordination to someone, or gives dependence to someone, or takes on a sikkhamānā or a sāmaṇerī, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 132nd rule.)
