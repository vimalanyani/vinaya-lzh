<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時世尊在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。時尉次比丘尼，為僧所舉，如法如律、如佛所教，不順從、有罪不懺悔，僧未與作共住。時偷羅難陀比丘尼，不白尼僧，僧不約勅，輒自出界外，與尉次作解罪羯磨。時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，呵責偷羅難陀比丘尼：「云何尼僧如法如律、如佛所教，舉尉次比丘尼，而不順從、有罪不懺悔，僧未與作共住。尼僧不約勅，汝輒自出界外與解罪？」</lzh>
At that time, the World-honored One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park. Then Weici bhikkhunī had been suspended by the sangha according to dhamma and vinaya, according to the Buddha’s teaching, but she didn’t comply, didn’t repent from her offenses, and the sangha hadn’t yet allowed her back to live with the community again. Then Thullanandā bhikkhunī, without informing the bhikkhunī sangha, without the sangha’s approval, just went outside the territory and carried out the formal act for Weici to release her from the offense. When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They criticized Thullanandā bhikkhunī: “The bhikkhunī sangha has suspended Weici bhikkhunī according to dhamma and vinaya, according to the Buddha’s teaching, but she doesn’t comply, doesn’t repent from her offenses, and the sangha hasn’t yet allowed her back to live with the community again. Why did you, without the bhikkhunī sangha’s approval, just go outside the territory and release her from the offense?”

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集諸比丘僧，呵責偷羅難陀：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何偷羅難陀！尼僧如法如律、如佛所教，舉尉次比丘尼，而不順從、有罪不悔，僧未與作共住。尼僧不約勅，汝輒自出界外與作羯磨解罪？」爾時世尊告諸比丘：「偷羅難陀多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，知比丘尼為僧所舉，如法如律、如佛所教，不順從、未懺悔，僧未與作共住羯磨。為愛故，不問僧、僧不約勅，出界外作羯磨與解罪，是比丘尼犯初法應捨，僧伽婆尸沙。」</lzh>
Then the bhikkhunīs told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized Thullanandā: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Thullanandā, when the bhikkhunī sangha had suspended Weici bhikkhunī according to dhamma and vinaya, according to the Buddha’s teaching, but when she didn’t comply, didn’t repent, and when the sangha hadn’t yet allowed her back to live with the community again, why did you, without the bhikkhunī sangha’s approval, just go outside the territory and carry out the formal act to release her from the offense?” Then the World-honored One said to the bhikkhus: “Thullanandā has all kinds of taints, and is the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī knows that another bhikkhunī has been suspended by the sangha according to dhamma and vinaya, according to the Buddha’s teaching, but doesn’t comply, hasn’t repented, and the sangha hasn’t yet carried out the formal act of living with the community, but out of affection, without asking the sangha, without the sangha’s approval, she goes outside the territory and carries out the formal act to release her from the offense, that bhikkhunī commits an immediate offense that should be given up, a saṅghādisesa.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>僧者，如上說。</lzh>
“Sangha” is as explained above.

<lzh>舉者，僧所舉白四羯磨也。</lzh>
“Suspended” means suspended by the sangha in a formal act with a motion as fourth.

<lzh>法者，如法如律、如佛所教。</lzh>
“Dhamma” means, according to dhamma and vinaya, according to the Buddha’s teaching.

<lzh>不順從者，佛所制治罪法不行。</lzh>
“Doesn’t comply” means doesn’t follow the procedures laid down by the Buddha for clearing the offense.

<lzh>不悔者，有罪不向人說。</lzh>
“Doesn’t repent” means there are offenses that she doesn’t tell people about.

<lzh>未與作共住者，為僧所舉未與解罪。</lzh>
“Not yet carried out the (formal act of) living with the community” means the person suspended by the sangha hasn’t yet been released from the offense.

<lzh>愛故不問僧、僧不約勅，出界外作羯磨與解罪，三羯磨竟，僧伽婆尸沙。白二羯磨竟，三偷羅遮。白一羯磨竟，二偷羅遮。白竟，一偷羅遮。白未竟，突吉羅。未白前集眾眾滿，一切突吉羅。</lzh>
If someone out of affection, without asking the sangha, without the sangha’s approval, goes outside the territory and carries out the formal act to release her from the offense, then when the three announcements are over, it’s a saṅghādisesa. When the motion and two announcements are over, they’re three thullaccayas. When the motion and one announcement are over, they’re two thullaccayas. When the motion is over, it’s one thullaccaya. If the motion hasn’t yet been finished, it’s a dukkaṭa. If they haven’t yet done the motion, when they gather the sangha, or when the assembly is complete, in all cases it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，白眾僧，若被僧約勅，若能下意悔本罪，若僧以恚故不與解罪、彼人與解，無犯。若先僧與作羯磨已，此僧移或死，若遠行、若休道，為賊所將去、為水所漂，彼與解罪，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she informs the sangha, if she gets the sangha’s approval, if she can make (the offender) submit and confess the original offense, and if the sangha doesn’t release her from the offense out of ill-will, and she releases that person, the offense isn’t committed. If the first sangha who had carried out the formal act moves, dies, goes on a long journey, disrobes, is abducted by criminals, or washed away by water, and she releases that person from the offense, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。(六竟)</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the sixth rule.)
