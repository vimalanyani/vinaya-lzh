<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時偷羅難陀比丘尼，到時著衣持鉢詣一居士家敷座而坐。時彼居士婦，脫身瓔珞衣服入後園洗浴。時偷羅難陀比丘尼，輒著他瓔珞衣服，在居士床上臥。時彼居士，先出行不在，後行還至家內，卒見偷羅難陀，意謂是己婦，即便就臥，手捉捫摸嗚口。彼捫摸時，覺其頭禿，方問言：「汝是何人？」報言：「我是偷羅難陀比丘尼。」居士語言：「汝何故著我婦瓔珞衣服？在我床上臥，令我見已謂是我婦。汝可速去！自今已去莫復更來入我家。」</lzh>
Then Thullanandā bhikkhunī, when the right time had come, put on her robes, took her bowl, went to a householder’s home, and sat down on a laid out seat. The lady of the house had removed her ornaments and clothes and had entered the backyard to bathe. Then Thullanandā bhikkhunī just put on her ornaments and clothes, and lay down on the householders’ bed. When the householder, who had earlier gone out and not been there, but who later returned and entered the house, suddenly saw Thullanandā, he thought it was his wife. Then he immediately lay down, took her hand, caressed her, and kissed her mouth. When he caressed her, he noticed that her head was bald, and then he asked: “Who’re you?” She replied: “I’m Thullanandā bhikkhunī.” The householder said: “Why do you wear my wife’s ornaments and clothes, and lie on my bed? When I saw you, it made me think you’re my wife. Quickly leave! From now on, don’t come and enter my house again!”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責偷羅難陀言：「汝云何著他婦瓔珞衣服在床上臥？」即往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責偷羅難陀言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何入居士家，著他婦瓔珞衣服在床上臥，使居士嫌怪耶？」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼入白衣舍內，在小床、大床上，若坐、若臥，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked Thullanandā: “Why did you put on the wife’s ornaments and clothes and lie down on the bed?” Then they went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha and criticized Thullanandā: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you enter a lay house, put on the wife’s ornaments and clothes and lie down on the bed, which made the householder upset and blame you?” When he had criticized her in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “This bhikkhunī has all kinds of taints, and is the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī enters a lay house and sits or lies down on a small or large bed, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>白衣舍者，村。</lzh>
“A lay house” means a village.

<lzh>小床者，坐床。</lzh>
“A small bed” means a bench for sitting.

<lzh>大床者，臥床。</lzh>
“A large bed” means a bed for sleeping.

<lzh>彼比丘尼，入白衣舍內，在小床、大床上若坐若臥，隨脇著床，一轉一一波逸提。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī enters a lay house and sits or lies down on a small or large bed, whenever she places her flanks on the bed, each time she turns over is a pācittiya.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，或時有如是病，若坐獨坐床，若為比丘尼僧敷眾多坐，若病倒地，若為強力者所執，若被繫閉，若命難、梵行難，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she has a certain illness at that time, if she sits on a one-person bench, if she lays out many seats for the bhikkhunī sangha, if she’s sick and falls to the ground, if she’s held by force, if she’s imprisoned, if her life is in danger, or if her celibacy is in danger, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 115th rule.)
