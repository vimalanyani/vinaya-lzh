<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞世尊制戒年十八童女，與二歲學戒，與六法滿，二十與授具足戒。彼不與六法，便與授具足戒。彼學戒時，作不淨行、盜取五錢、斷人命、自稱得上人法、過中食、飲酒。</lzh>
Then the bhikkhunīs heard that the World-honored One had laid down a precept that 18 year old girls who have been given the training precepts for two years, and who have been given the six rules, may be given the full ordination when they’re 20. They gave the full ordination to people who hadn’t been given the six rules. When they trained in the precepts, they engaged in impure practices, stole (something worth) five coins, took the life of human beings, praised themselves as having attained a superhuman state, ate after noon, and drank alcohol.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責諸比丘尼言：「世尊制戒年十八童女，與二歲學戒，與六法滿，二十與授具足戒。汝云何不教六法事授具足戒，犯梵行、盜五錢乃至飲酒？」即白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責彼比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。汝等比丘尼應年十八童女，與二歲學戒，與六法，滿二十與授具足戒。而云何不與六法，令犯婬乃至飲酒耶？」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked these bhikkhunīs: “The World-honored One has laid down a precept that 18 year old girls who have trained for two years in the precepts, and who have been given the six rules, may be given the full ordination when they’re 20. Why did you give the full ordination without instructing them in the six rules? They broke their celibacy, stole (something worth) five coins, … and drank alcohol.” Then they told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha and criticized these bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. You, bhikkhunīs, should give the training precepts to 18 year old girls for two years, and give the six rules, and when they’re 20, give them the full ordination. But why did you not give them the six rules, which made them break their celibacy, … and drink alcohol?” 

<lzh>以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，年十八童女，與二歲學戒，不與六法，滿二十便與授具足戒，波逸提。」</lzh>
When he had criticized them in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī gives the training precepts to an 18 year old girl for two years, but doesn’t give her the six rules, and when she’s 20, still gives her the full ordination, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>若式叉摩那犯婬，應滅擯。若有染污心與染污心男子身相觸，缺戒，應更與戒。若偷五錢過五錢，應滅擯。若減五錢，缺戒，應更與戒。若斷人命，應滅擯。若斷畜生命，缺戒，應更與戒。若自言得上人法者，應滅擯。若在眾中故妄語者，缺戒，應更與戒。若非時食，缺戒，應更與戒。若飲酒，缺戒，應更與戒。</lzh>
If a sikkhamānā has sex, she should be permanently expelled. If with a defiled mind, she and a man with a defiled mind touch each other, she’s deficient in her precepts and should be given the precepts again. If she steals (something worth) five coins or more than five coins, she should be permanently expelled. If it’s less than five coins, she’s deficient in her precepts and should be given the precepts again. If she takes the life of a human being, she should be permanently expelled. If she takes the life of an animal, she’s deficient in her precepts and should be given the precepts again. If she says about herself that she has attained a superhuman state, she should be permanently expelled. If she intentionally lies in the sangha, she’s deficient in her precepts and should be given the precepts again. If she eats at the wrong time, she’s deficient in her precepts and should be given the precepts again. If she drinks alcohol, she’s deficient in her precepts and should be given the precepts again. 

<lzh>若比丘尼，年十八童女，與二歲學戒，不與六法，滿二十便與授具足戒，唱三羯磨竟，尼和上，波逸提。白二羯磨竟，三突吉羅。白一羯磨，二突吉羅。白已，一突吉羅。白未竟，一突吉羅。未白前集眾及眾滿，一切突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī has given the training precepts to an 18 year old girl for two years, but hasn’t given her the six rules, and still gives her the full ordination when she’s 20, when they’ve proclaimed the three announcements, the preceptor commits a pācittiya. When they’ve carried out the motion and two announcements, it’s three dukkaṭas. When they’ve carried out the motion and one announcement, it’s two dukkaṭas. When they’ve carried out the motion, it’s one dukkaṭa. If the motion hasn’t been finished yet, it’s a dukkaṭa. If they haven’t done the motion yet, when they gather the sangha, or when the assembly is complete, in all cases it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，年十八童女，二歲學戒，與六法已受具足戒，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if an 18 year old girl has trained for two years in the precepts, has been given the six rules, and is given the full ordination, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 123rd rule.)
