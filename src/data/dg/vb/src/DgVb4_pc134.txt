<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼，聞世尊制戒聽度人授具足戒，而父母夫主不聽，輒便度與授具足戒。與授具足戒已，父母夫主皆來將去。</lzh>
Then the bhikkhunīs heard that the World-honored One had laid down a precept and allowed to give the full ordination to others, and they just gave the full ordination without the approval of the parents and the husbands. When they had given the full ordination, the parents and husbands came and took (the new bhikkhunīs) away.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，呵責言：「汝等云何世尊制戒聽度人，父母夫主不聽而度，使父母夫主還將去耶？」時諸比丘尼往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責諸比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何汝等世尊制戒聽度人，父母夫主不聽而輒度，後為父母夫主還將去？」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此諸比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，父母夫主不聽與授具足戒者，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They criticized them: “Why did you, when the World-honored One had laid down a precept and allowed to ordain people, just ordain without the approval of the parents and the husbands, which made the parents and husbands come and take (the new bhikkhunīs) back?” Then the bhikkhunīs went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha and criticized these bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you, when the World-honored One had laid down a precept and allowed to ordain people, just ordain without the approval of the parents and the husbands? Later, (the new bhikkhunīs) were taken back by their parents and husbands.” When he had criticized them in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī gives the full ordination without the approval of the parents or the husband, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼，若父母夫主不聽與授具足戒，三羯磨竟，尼和上，波逸提。白二羯磨，三突吉羅。白一羯磨，二突吉羅。白已，一突吉羅。白未竟，突吉羅。未白前方便白僧與剃髮集眾眾滿，一切突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī gives the full ordination without the approval of the parents or the husband, when they’ve carried out the three announcements, the preceptor commits a pācittiya. When they’ve carried out the motion and two announcements, it’s three dukkaṭas. When they’ve carried out the motion and one announcement, it’s two dukkaṭas. When they’ve carried out the motion, it’s one dukkaṭa. If the motion hasn’t been finished yet, it’s a dukkaṭa. If they haven’t done the motion yet, when they plan to inform the sangha, when they shave the head, when they gather the sangha, or when the assembly is complete, in all cases it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，父母夫主聽，若無父母夫主，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if her parents or husband have allowed it, or if she doesn’t have parents or a husband, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 134th rule.)
