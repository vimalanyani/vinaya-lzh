<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在周那絺羅國。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Cundaṭṭhīla. 

<lzh>六群比丘尼，被擯而不去。</lzh>
Then a group-of-six bhikkhunī had been expelled, but didn’t leave.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，呵責六群比丘尼：「汝云何被擯而不去？」即白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責六群比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何被擯而不去？」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，被擯不去者，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunī: “Why did you not leave when you had been expelled?” Then they told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunī: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you not leave when you had been expelled?” When he had criticized her in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “This bhikkhunī has all kinds of taints, and is the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī has been expelled and doesn’t leave, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>若比丘尼被擯應去而不去，波逸提。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī has been expelled and should leave, but doesn’t leave, it’s a pācittiya.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，若被擯即去，若隨順不逆、下意悔過、求解擯羯磨，或得病、或無伴去、或水陸道斷、或賊難、或惡獸難、或大水瀑漲、或為強力者所執、若被繫閉、或命難、梵行難，被擯而不去者，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she has been expelled and then leaves, if she complies, doesn’t oppose it, is humble, confesses the offense, and asks for release from the formal act of expulsion, or if she gets sick, if there’s no companion to go, if a waterway or overland road has been cut off, if there’s a danger from criminals, if there’s a danger from savage animals, if a large body of water with a strong current is flooding, if she’s held by force, if she’s imprisoned, if her life is in danger, or if her celibacy is in danger, and she has been expelled but doesn’t leave, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 171st rule.)
