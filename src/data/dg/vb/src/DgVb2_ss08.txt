<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時佛在舍衛國，時世穀米勇貴，乞食難得。時有比丘尼入城乞食，空鉢而還。時提舍難陀比丘尼，到時著衣持鉢入城乞食，漸次到一販賣人家默然而立。是堤舍比丘尼顏貌端政，販賣人見已便繫心在彼，即前問言：「阿姨！何所求索？」報言：「我欲乞食。」彼言：「授鉢來。」即便與鉢。彼盛滿鉢羹飯，授與堤舍比丘尼。堤舍比丘尼後數數著衣持鉢詣販賣人家默然而立。彼復問言：「阿姨！何所求索？」報言：「我欲乞食。」彼即復盛滿鉢羹飯授與。諸比丘尼見已便問言：「如今穀米勇貴，乞求難得，我等諸人入城乞食空鉢而還，汝日日乞食滿鉢而來，何由得爾？」</lzh>
At that time, the Buddha was at Sāvatthī. Then, grain and rice had become very expensive in the world, and almsfood was hard to get. The bhikkhunīs entered the city on almsround, and returned with empty bowls. Then Tissanandā bhikkhunī, when the right time had come, put on her robes, took her bowl, and entered the city on almsround. Walking on continuous round, she came to a merchant’s home, and stood there silently. Tissanandā was good-looking, and when the merchant saw her, his mind attached to her. In front of her, he asked: “Venerable, what are you looking for?” She replied: “I want almsfood.” He said: “Give me your bowl.” Then she gave him her bowl, he filled it up with curries and rice, and gave it back to Tissā bhikkhunī. Later, Tissā bhikkhunī often put on her robes, took her bowl, went to the merchant’s home, and stood there silently. He again asked her: “Venerable, what are you looking for?” She replied: “I want almsfood.” He then again filled up her bowl with curries and rice, and gave it to her. When the bhikkhunīs saw it, they asked: “As now grain and rice have become very expensive and almsfood is hard to get, we all enter the city on almsround, and return with empty bowls. But you come back from almsround every day with a full bowl. How do you do that?”

<lzh>報言：「諸妹乞可得耳。」堤舍比丘尼復於異日，到時著衣持鉢詣販賣人家。彼人遙見比丘尼來，便自計念：「如我前後與此比丘尼食，計價可五百金錢，足直一女人。」即前捉比丘尼欲行婬，比丘尼即喚言：「莫爾！莫爾。」比近販賣者即問言：「向者何故大喚？」答言：「此人捉我。」彼問言：「汝何故捉比丘尼耶？」販賣人答言：「我前後與此比丘尼食，計其價可五百金錢，足直一女人。若此比丘尼意不貪樂我者，何以受我食？」彼人問比丘尼言：「汝實爾不？」答言：「實爾。」彼問比丘尼言：「汝知彼與汝食意不？」答言：「知。」彼復言：「汝若知者何故大喚？」</lzh>
She replied: “Younger sisters, I obtain it on almsround.” On another day, Tissā bhikkhunī, when the right time had come, put on her robes, took her bowl, and went to the merchant’s home. That man had seen the bhikkhunī from a distance, and thought calculatingly: “As I constantly give this bhikkhunī food, I’ve spent the sum of about 500 gold coins. That’s the price of a woman.” Then, he grabbed the bhikkhunī from the front, and wanted to have sexual intercourse. The bhikkhunī called out: “Don’t do that! Don’t do that!” The merchants closeby then asked her: “Why did you shout so loudly just now?” She answered: “This man grabbed me.” They asked him: “Why did you grab the bhikkhunī?” The merchant answered: “I constantly gave this bhikkhunī food. I’ve spent about 500 gold coins on her. That’s the price of a woman. If this bhikkhunī didn’t crave for me, why did she accept my food?” The people asked the bhikkhunī: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this.” They asked the bhikkhunī: “Did you know his intention for giving you food?” She answered: “I knew.” Then they said again: “If you knew, why did you shout so loudly?”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責提舍難陀比丘尼：「云何比丘尼染污心受染污心人食？」諸比丘尼白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊爾時以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責提舍難陀比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何以染污心受染污心人食？」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此提舍難陀比丘尼！多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼有染污心，從染污心男子受可食者及食并餘物，是比丘尼犯初法應捨，僧伽婆尸沙。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked Tissanandā bhikkhunī: “Why does a bhikkhunī with a defiled mind accept food from a man with a defiled mind?” The bhikkhunīs told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized Tissanandā bhikkhunī: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you with a defiled mind accept food from a man with a defiled mind?” When he had criticized her in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “This Tissanandā bhikkhunī has all kinds of taints, and is the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: ‘If a bhikkhunī with a defiled mind accepts edibles, food, and other things, from a man with a defiled mind, that bhikkhunī commits an immediate offense that should be given up, a saṅghādisesa.’”

<lzh>如是世尊與比丘尼結戒。時諸比丘尼，亦不知有染污心、無染污心，後方知有染污心，或有言犯僧伽婆尸沙，或有疑者。「不知者，不犯。自今已去當如是說戒：若比丘尼染污心，知染污心男子，從彼受可食者及食并餘物，是比丘尼犯初法應捨，僧伽婆尸沙。」</lzh>
In this way the World-honored One laid down the precept for the bhikkhunīs. Then the bhikkhunīs didn’t know if someone had a defiled mind or not, and they only found out later that they had a defiled mind. Some said that they had committed a saṅghādisesa. Some had doubts. (The Buddha said:) “If you don’t know, there’s no offense. From now on, you should recite the precept like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī with a defiled mind knows that a man has a defiled mind, and accepts edibles, food, and other things from him, that bhikkhunī commits an immediate offense that should be given up, a saṅghādisesa.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>染污心者，欲染著心。</lzh>
“A defiled mind” means a lustful mind with defiled attachment. 

<lzh>染污心男子者，亦欲心染著。</lzh>
“A man with a defiled mind” means also a lustful mind with defiled attachment.

<lzh>可食者，根食、莖食、葉食、華食、果食、油食、胡麻食、黑石蜜食、細末食也。</lzh>
“Edibles”<note> khādanīya</note> means food from roots, stalks, leaves, flowers, fruits, oil, sesame, black sugar, or from powder.

<lzh>食者，飯、麨、乾飯、魚及肉。</lzh>
“Food”<note> bhojanīya</note> means cooked rice, flour, dried cooked rice, fish and meat.

<lzh>餘物者，金銀、珍寶、摩尼、真珠、玭琉璃、珂貝、璧玉、珊瑚、若錢、生像金。</lzh>
“Other things” means gold<note> Possibly a translation of suvaṇṇa. Gold appears twice in this list, and the second time is a translation of jātarūpa.</note>, silver, jewels, gems, pearls, beryl, shells, jade, corals, money, and gold<note> jātarūpa 生像</note>.

<lzh>若比丘尼染污心，知染污心男子，從受可食物及食并餘物者，彼與此受，僧伽婆尸沙。彼與此不受，偷蘭遮。方便欲與而不與，若共期若悔還，一切偷蘭遮。天子、阿修羅子、揵闥婆子、夜叉子、餓鬼子、畜生能變形者，從受可食者及食并餘物，彼與此受，偷蘭遮。不能變形者，突吉羅。從染污心女人，受可食者及食并餘物，突吉羅。染污心染污心想，僧伽婆尸沙。染污心疑，偷蘭遮。不染污心染污心想，偷蘭遮。不染污心疑，突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī with a defiled mind knows that a man has a defiled mind, and accepts edibles, food, and other things from him, if he gives it and she accepts it, it’s a saṅghādisesa. If he gives it and she doesn’t accept it, it’s a thullaccaya. If he plans and wishes to give, but then doesn’t give, or if they make an appointment, but she regrets it and goes back, in all cases it’s a thullaccaya. If she accepts edibles, food, and other things from a god, an asura, a gandhabba, a yakkha, a hungry ghost, or an animal that can change shape, if he gives it and she accepts it, it’s a thullaccaya. If it can’t change shape, it’s a dukkaṭa. If she accepts edibles, food, and other things from a woman with a defiled mind, it’s a dukkaṭa. If the other has a defiled mind and she perceives it as a defiled mind, it’s a saṅghādisesa. If he has a defiled mind and she’s in doubt about it, it’s a thullaccaya. If he doesn’t have a defiled mind and she perceives it as a defiled mind, it’s a thullaccaya. If he doesn’t have a defiled mind and she’s in doubt about it, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，先不知，若己無染污心、彼亦無染污心，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she doesn’t know at first, or if she has an undefiled mind and he also has an undefiled mind, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。(八竟)</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the eighth rule.)
