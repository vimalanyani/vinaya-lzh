<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時偷羅難陀比丘尼，安居初聽餘比丘尼在房中敷床，安居中㥲恚挽床驅出。時彼比丘尼慚愧懼失宿，即便休道。</lzh>
Then Thullanandā bhikkhunī, at the beginning of the rains retreat, allowed another bhikkhunī to lay out a bed in her building. In the middle of the rains retreat, she dragged her bed out angrily, and expelled her. Then that bhikkhunī was ashamed and feared to lose her residence, and so she disrobed.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責偷羅難陀比丘尼：「汝云何安居初聽餘比丘尼在房中安床，安居中㥲恚挽床驅出，使彼慚愧休道？」時諸比丘尼往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊爾時以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責偷羅難陀比丘尼：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何偷羅難陀比丘尼，安居初聽餘比丘尼在房中安床，安居中㥲恚挽床驅出，使彼慚愧休道？」時世尊以無數方便呵責偷羅難陀比丘尼已，告諸比丘：「此偷羅難陀比丘尼！多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼安居初聽餘比丘尼在房中安床，後㥲恚驅出者，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked Thullanandā bhikkhunī: “Why did you, at the beginning of the rains retreat, allow another bhikkhunī to set up a bed in your building, but in the middle of the rains retreat, drag her bed out angrily, and expel her, which made her ashamed and disrobe?” Then the bhikkhunīs went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized Thullanandā bhikkhunī: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why, Thullanandā bhikkhunī, did you, at the beginning of the rains retreat, allow another bhikkhunī to set up a bed in your building, but in the middle of the rains retreat, drag her bed out angrily, and expel her, which made her ashamed and disrobe?” Then, when the World-honored One had criticized Thullanandā bhikkhunī in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “This Thullanandā bhikkhunī has all kinds of taints, and is the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī at the beginning of the rains retreat allows another bhikkhunī to set up a bed in her building, but later angrily expels her, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>安居中者，受安居已。</lzh>
“In the middle of the rains retreat” means when the rains retreat has been undertaken.

<lzh>床者，五種床如上。</lzh>
“A bed” means the five kinds of beds as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼安居初聽餘比丘尼在房中安床，後㥲恚驅出，隨作方便，隨出門一一波逸提。若方便驅眾多人出眾多戶，眾多波逸提。若方便驅眾多人出一戶，眾多波逸提。若方便驅一人出眾多戶，眾多波逸提。若方便驅一人出一戶，一波逸提。若出餘衣物者，突吉羅。若閉戶使不得入，突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī at the beginning of the rains retreat allows another bhikkhunī to set up a bed in her building, but later angrily expels her, then whenever she makes plans and whenever (the other) leaves through the door, each time is a pācittiya. If she plans to expel several people through several doors, it’s several pācittiyas. If she plans to expel several people through one door, it’s several pācittiyas. If she plans to expel one person through several doors, it’s several pācittiyas. If she plans to expel one person through one door, it’s one pācittiya. If she takes the other’s robes or things out, it’s a dukkaṭa. If she closes a door to not let her enter, it’s a dukkaṭa. 

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，不以㥲恚，隨上座次驅下座出；未受大戒人共宿，過二宿第三宿驅出；若令病人出在大小便處便利；若破戒、破見、破威儀、若被舉、若滅擯、若應滅擯；若以此事命難、梵行難，一切驅出，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s not angry and according to seniority she expels a junior one, if she stays together overnight with someone who hasn’t received the full ordination yet, and when two nights have passed, she expels her on the third night, if she makes a sick person go out to relieve herself in the toilet, if (the other) breaks the precepts, breaks right view, breaks proper conduct, if (the other) is suspended, permanently expelled, or should be permanently expelled, or if because of this matter her life is in danger or her celibacy is in danger, and she expels her, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 94th rule.)
