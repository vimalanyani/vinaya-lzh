<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時六群比丘尼，以世俗技術教授諸白衣語言：「汝等莫向日月及神祀廟舍大小便，亦莫向日月神祀除去糞掃，及諸蕩器不淨水，莫向日月神祀舒脚。若欲起房舍耕田種作，當向日月及向神祀廟舍。」又言：「今日某甲星宿日好，宜種作作舍、宜使作人、宜與小兒剃髮、亦宜長髮、宜剃鬚、宜舉取財物、宜遠行。」</lzh>
Then the group-of-six bhikkhunī instructed lay people in worldly skills: “Don’t defecate and urinate in the direction of the sun, the moon, or a shrine-house of the gods, also don’t throw away your garbage or the dirty dish-washing water in the direction of the sun, the moon, or a shrine of the gods, and don’t stretch out your feet towards the sun, the moon, or a shrine of the gods. If you want to build a building, till a field, or do the planting, you should do it in the direction of the sun, the moon, or a shrine-house of the gods.” They also said: “Today the stellar constellations are such and such. It’s a good day, suitable for planting or for building a house, suitable for employing workers, suitable for shaving the head of small children, suitable for growing one’s hair, suitable for shaving the beard, suitable for increasing wealth, and suitable for going on long journeys.”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責六群比丘尼言：「汝云何乃以如是技術教授白衣語言：『汝等知不？莫向日月神祀廟舍大小便，乃至宜出遠行。』」即白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責六群比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何六群比丘尼，乃以世俗技術教授長者家語言：『汝知不？莫向日月所迴旋處大小便，乃至宜出遠行。』耶？」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，以世俗技術教授白衣，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “Why did you instruct lay people in the following skills: ‘Did you know? Don’t defecate and urinate in the direction of the sun, the moon, or a shrine-house of the gods … suitable for going on long journeys’?” Then they told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha and criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why, group-of-six bhikkhunīs, did you instruct householders in worldly skills: ‘Did you know? Don’t defecate and urinate in the direction of the sun, the moon, or places of circumambulation … suitable for going on long journeys’?” When he had criticized them in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī instructs lay people in worldly skills, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>技術者，如上所說。</lzh>
“Skills” is as explained above.

<lzh>若欲說者當語彼人言：「莫向如來塔及聲聞塔大小便，及除棄糞掃蕩器不淨水，亦莫向如來塔及聲聞塔舒脚，若欲起房舍及耕田種作者，當向如來塔及聲聞塔。」又不得言：「今日有如是星宿好，宜起舍宜種作、宜使作人、宜為小兒剃髮、長髮、剃鬚。」應語言：「宜入塔寺供養比丘僧受齋法，八日十四日十五日現變化日。」彼比丘尼，以如是世俗技術教授白衣乃至宜出遠行，說而了了者，波逸提；不了了者，突吉羅。</lzh>
If someone wants to say something, she should say to another person: “Don’t defecate and urinate in the direction of a stupa of the Tathāgata or a stupa of a disciple, or throw away your garbage or the dirty dish-washing water, also don’t stretch out your feet towards a stupa of the Tathāgata or a stupa of a disciple. If you want to build a building, till a field, or do the planting, you should do it in the direction of a stupa of the Tathāgata or a stupa of a disciple.” It’s not allowable to say: “Today there are such and such good stellar constellations, it’s suitable for building a house, suitable for planting, suitable for employing workers, suitable to shave the head of small children, suitable for growing one’s hair, suitable for shaving the beard.” She should say: “It’s suitable to enter a stupa or a monastery, support the bhikkhu sangha, and undertake the fasting after midday on the eighth day, the fourteenth day, the fifteenth day, and the transformation days<note> pāṭihāriya days</note>.” If a bhikkhunī instructs lay people in worldly skills … ‘suitable for going on long journeys’, and if she speaks and others understand, it’s a pācittiya. If others don’t understand, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，教言：「莫向如來塔及聲聞塔大小便及除糞掃不淨水，亦莫向如來塔及聲聞塔舒脚，若耕田種作若起房舍，向如來塔乃至受齋法。」若戲笑語、若疾疾語、若獨語、夢中語、欲說此乃錯說彼，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she instructs them: “Don’t defecate and urinate in the direction of a stupa of the Tathāgata or a stupa of a disciple, or throw away your garbage or dirty water, also don’t stretch out your feet towards a stupa of the Tathāgata or a stupa of a disciple. If you want to till a field, do the planting, or build a building, you should do it in the direction of a stupa of the Tathāgata … undertake the fasting after midday,” if she says it jokingly, if she speaks quickly, if she speaks when she’s alone, if she speaks in a dream, or if she wants to say one thing but by mistake says something else, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 170th rule.)
