<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時六群比丘尼欲意熾盛顏色憔悴形體羸瘦，往詣波斯匿王宮。時宮中諸婦女見已問言：「阿姨何所患苦？」答言：「以不從願故。」問言：「有何願不從？」答言：「我婬心熾盛。」諸婦女言：「我等在宮內，時時乃得男子。若不得時，以胡膠雜物作男根內女根中，既適婬意不名行婬，諸尊何不如是作？」諸比丘尼報言：「諸姊！世尊制戒不得爾。」彼即復言：「阿姨！我等在宮，時時乃得男子。若不得男子時，共相拍以適婬樂不名行婬，阿姨何不爾？」時二六群比丘尼共相拍，餘比丘尼見謂共男子行婬，起已方知非男子。</lzh>
Then the group-of-six bhikkhunīs, burning with lustful thoughts, looking haggard, with weak and feeble bodies, went to the palace of King Pasenadi. When the women in the palace saw them, they asked: “Venerables, from what do you suffer?” They answered: “It’s because we can’t follow our wishes.” They asked: “What’s the wish you can’t follow?” They answered: “We’re burning with lustful minds.” The women said: “We’re inside the palace. From time to time, we obtain a man. If we don’t obtain a man, we mix something with gum, make a dildo, and insert it into the vagina. Then we enjoy ourselves sexually, and it’s not called engaging in sexual intercourse. Why don’t the venerables do this?” The bhikkhunīs replied: “Sisters, the World-honored One has laid down a precept that this isn’t allowed.” Then they said again: “Venerables, we’re in the palace. From time to time, we obtain a man. If we don’t obtain a man, we pat each other to enjoy sexual pleasures, and it’s not called engaging in sexual intercourse. Why don’t the venerables do this?” Then two group-of-six bhikkhunīs patted each other. The other bhikkhunīs saw them and said: “She’s having sex with a man.” When they got up, then they knew that it wasn’t a man.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責六群比丘尼言：「汝等云何共相拍？」時諸比丘尼往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責六群比丘尼：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。汝等云何共相拍？」世尊以無數方便呵責六群比丘尼已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼共相拍，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “Why did you pat each other?” Then the bhikkhunīs went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you pat each other?” When the World-honored One had criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If bhikkhunīs pat each other, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>拍者，若以手掌、若脚拍、若女根女根相拍、若比丘尼共相拍。拍者，突吉羅。受拍者，波逸提。若二女根共相拍，二俱波逸提。</lzh>
“Patting” means patting with the palm of the hand, or with the foot, or with one vagina against the other; if bhikkhunīs pat each other, for the one who pats, it’s a dukkaṭa, and for the one who is patted, it’s a pācittiya. If both pat each other’s vaginas, it’s two full pācittiyas.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，或有如是病、或來去、若經行、若掃地、若以杖觸不故作、若洗時手觸，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she has a certain illness, if she comes and goes, if she does walking meditation, if she sweeps the ground, if she unintentionally touches it with a cane, or if she touches it with the hand while washing it, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 74th rule.)
