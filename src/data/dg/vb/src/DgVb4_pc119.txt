<h2>First Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時佛在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Buddha was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時有一比丘尼名婆羅，度他妊娠女人受具足戒已，後便生男兒，自抱入村乞食。時諸居士見已皆譏嫌言：「此比丘尼，不知慚愧犯不淨行，外自稱言：『我修正法。』如是何有正法？看此出家人新生兒。」</lzh>
Then there was a bhikkhunī called Pālā. When she had given the full ordination to a pregnant woman, (the woman) later gave birth to a boy. Holding him in her arms, she entered the village on almsround. When the householders saw this, they were all upset and said: “This bhikkhunī knows no shame, she has committed impure practices. Outwardly, she praises herself: ‘I know the true dhamma’, how is that the true dhamma? Look at this renunciate’s newly-born baby.”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，呵責婆羅比丘尼言：「汝云何度他妊娠女人？」往白諸比丘，諸比丘白佛。佛以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責婆羅比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何度他妊娠女人？」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼度他妊娠女人授具足戒者，波逸提。」如是世尊與比丘尼結戒。</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They criticized Pālā bhikkhunī: “Why did you ordain a pregnant woman?” They went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus told the Buddha. The Buddha for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha and criticized Pālā bhikkhunī: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you ordain a pregnant woman?” When he had criticized her in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “This bhikkhunī has all kinds of taints, and is the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Preliminary Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī gives the full ordination to a pregnant woman, it’s a pācittiya.’” In this way the World-honored One laid down the precept for the bhikkhunīs.


<h2>Second Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>時諸比丘尼，不知妊娠不妊娠，後乃知妊娠，其中或作波逸提懺或疑。「不知者無犯。自今已去當如是說戒：若比丘尼，知女人妊娠，度與授具足戒者，波逸提。」</lzh>
Then the bhikkhunīs didn’t know who was pregnant and who wasn’t, and they only found out later that someone was pregnant. Some among them confessed a pācittiya. Some had doubts. (The Buddha said:) “If you don’t know, there’s no offense. From now on, you should recite the precept like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī knows that a woman is pregnant and gives her the full ordination, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼，若知女人妊娠，度授具足戒，作三羯磨竟，和上尼，波逸提。白二羯磨竟三，突吉羅。白一羯磨竟二，突吉羅。白已，一突吉羅。白未竟，突吉羅。未白前與剃頭著衣與受戒，若集眾眾滿，一切突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī knows that a woman is pregnant and gives her the full ordination, when they’ve carried out the three announcements, the preceptor commits a pācittiya. When they’ve carried out the motion and two announcements, it’s three dukkaṭas. When they’ve carried out the motion and one announcement, it’s two dukkaṭas. When they’ve carried out the motion, it’s one dukkaṭa. If the motion hasn’t been finished yet, it’s a dukkaṭa. If they haven’t done the motion yet, when they shave her head, when she puts on the robes, when they give her the (sāmaṇerī) precepts, when they gather the sangha, or when the assembly is complete, in all cases it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，若不知。若信彼人言、若信可信人語、或信父母語，與受具足戒後生兒，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she doesn’t know, if she believes that person’s words, if she believes a trustworthy person’s words, if she believes her parents’ words, and gives her the full ordination, and later (the new bhikkhunī) gives birth to a child, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>若生已，疑不敢捉抱。佛言：「若未能離母自活，聽一切如母法乳哺長養。」後有疑不敢與此男兒同室宿。佛言：「若未能離母宿，聽共一處宿。」無犯。</lzh>
When someone had given birth, she had doubts and didn’t dare to hold and embrace (the baby). The Buddha said: “If they can’t live apart from the mother yet, I allow to do everything as a mother does to breast-feed and nurture them.” Later, she had doubts and didn’t dare to stay overnight in the same room as this boy. The Buddha said: “If he can’t stay apart from the mother overnight yet, I allow to stay overnight in the same place.” Then the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 119th rule.)
