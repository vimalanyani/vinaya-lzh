<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時佛在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Buddha was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>爾時安隱比丘尼多度弟子而不教誡，以不被教授故，不按威儀、著衣不齊整、乞食不如法、處處受不淨食、或受不淨鉢食、在小食大食上高聲大喚，如婆羅門聚會法。時諸比丘尼見已語言：「妹！汝等云何不按威儀、著衣不齊整、乞食不如法、處處受不淨食、或受不淨鉢食、在小食大食上高聲大喚，如婆羅門聚會法？」諸比丘尼報言：「我是安隱比丘尼弟子，彼弟子眾多，而不教授我等，以不被教授故耳。」</lzh>
Then Khemā bhikkhunī ordained many students but didn’t instruct them. Because they weren’t instructed, they weren’t established in proper conduct, didn’t wear their robes neatly, did their almsround not according to dhamma, accepted improper food here and there, or accepted food in improper bowls, and shouted loudly during breakfast and lunch like at a gathering of brahmins. When the bhikkhunīs saw them, they said: “Younger sisters, why aren’t you established in proper conduct, don’t wear your robes neatly, do your almsround not according to dhamma, accept improper food here and there, accept food in improper bowls, and shout loudly during breakfast and lunch like at a gathering of brahmins?” These bhikkhunīs replied: “We’re Khemā bhikkhunī’s students. She has many students but doesn’t instruct us. Because she doesn’t instruct us, (we’re like this.)”

<lzh>爾時比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責安隱比丘尼言：「汝云何多度弟子而不教授？以不教授故，眾事不如法也。」呵責已往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責安隱比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何多度弟子不教授，不按威儀、著衣不齊整、乞食不如法、處處受不淨食、或受不淨鉢食、在小食大食上高聲大喚，如婆羅門聚會法？」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，多度弟子，不教二歲學戒，不以二法攝取，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked Khemā bhikkhunī: “Why did you ordain many students but didn’t instruct them? Because they weren’t instructed they did many things not according to dhamma.” Having criticized her, they went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha and criticized Khemā bhikkhunī: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you ordain many students but didn’t instruct them? They weren’t established in proper conduct, didn’t wear their robes neatly, did their almsround not according to dhamma, accepted improper food here and there, accepted food in improper bowls, and shouted loudly during breakfast and lunch like at a gathering of brahmins.” When he had criticized her in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “This bhikkhunī has all kinds of taints, and is the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī ordains many students, but doesn’t instruct them for two years in the training precepts, and doesn’t assist them in regard to the two things, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>二法者，一者法、二者衣食。</lzh>
“The two things” means one is the dhamma, and the other are robes and food.

<lzh>法攝取者，教增戒、增心、增慧、學問、誦經。</lzh>
“Assisting in dhamma” means teaching them in the higher virtue, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom, in knowledge, and in the recitation of suttas. 

<lzh>衣食攝者，與衣食、床、臥具、醫藥，隨力能辦供給所須。</lzh>
“Assisting with robes and food” means to give them robes, food, beds, bedding, and medicines, and to arrange support with the necessities according to her abilities.

<lzh>若比丘尼，多度弟子與授具足戒，不教二歲學戒、二法攝取，波逸提。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī ordains many students and gives them the full ordination, but doesn’t instruct them for two years in the training precepts, and doesn’t assist them in regard to the two things, it’s a pācittiya.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，若度與二歲學戒，以二事攝取：一者法，二者衣食；若受具足戒已離和上去；若破戒、破見、破威儀；若被舉、若滅擯、若應滅擯；以此事命難、梵行難，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she ordains them, gives them the training precepts for two years, and assists them in regard to the two things: one is the dhamma, the other are robes and food, if after they’ve received the full ordination they leave their preceptor, if they’ve broken the precepts, or have broken right view, or have broken proper conduct, and have been suspended, have been permanently expelled, or should be permanently expelled, and if for these reasons (the first bhikkhunī’s) life is in danger, or her celibacy is in danger, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 128th rule.)
