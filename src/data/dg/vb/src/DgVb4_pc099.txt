<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時有比丘尼，親近居士、居士兒共住作不隨順行。時諸比丘尼諫言：「汝莫親近居士、居士兒作不隨順行。汝，妹！可別住，汝若別住，於佛法中得增益安樂住。」而彼故不別住。
時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責彼比丘尼：「汝云何親近居士、居士兒共住作不隨順行？」時諸比丘尼往白諸比丘，諸比丘白佛。佛以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責彼比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何乃與居士、居士兒親近共住作不隨順行？」</lzh>
Then there was a bhikkhunī who lived closely together with a householder and a householder’s child, and engaged in practices not to be followed. Then the bhikkhunīs admonished her: “Don’t live closely together with a householder or a householder’s child, and engage in practices not to be followed. Younger sister, please live apart. If you live apart, you’ll grow in the Buddha’s dhamma and live comfortably.” But as before she didn’t live apart. 
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked this bhikkhunī: “Why did you live closely together with a householder and a householder’s child, and engage in practices not to be followed?” Then the bhikkhunīs went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus told the Buddha. The Buddha for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized this bhikkhunī: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you live closely together with a householder and a householder’s child, and engage in practices not to be followed?” 

<lzh>呵責已告諸比丘：「自今已去聽僧與彼比丘尼作呵責捨此事故白四羯磨。當作如是呵責捨此事，眾中應差堪能羯磨者如上，當作如是白：『大姊僧聽！此某甲比丘尼，親近居士、居士兒共住作不隨順行。餘比丘尼呵諫言：「汝妹！莫親近居士居士兒作不隨順行。汝，妹！可別住，汝若別住，於佛法有增益安樂住。」彼比丘尼故不改。若僧時到！僧忍聽僧與彼某甲比丘尼作呵責令捨此事：「汝，妹！莫親近居士、居士兒共住作不隨順行。汝，妹！可別住，若別住，於佛法有增益安樂住。」白如是。』</lzh>
Having criticized her, he said to the bhikkhus: “From now on, I allow that the sangha carries out a formal act of criticism with a motion as fourth for that bhikkhunī to give up this matter. They should carry out the criticism to give up this matter as follows: In the sangha, they should choose a capable person who can carry out formal acts as above. She should carry out the motion as follows: 


<h2>Saṅghakamma</h2>

‘Venerable sisters, may the sangha listen. This bhikkhunī So-and-so lives closely together with a householder and a householder’s child, and engages in practices not to be followed. The other bhikkhunīs criticized and admonished her: “Younger sister, don’t be close together with a householder or a householder’s child, and engage in practices not to be followed. Younger sister, please live apart. If you live apart, you’ll grow in the Buddha’s dhamma and live comfortably.” But that bhikkhunī did as before and didn’t change. If the right time has come for the sangha, may the sangha approve to carry out the criticism for bhikkhunī So-and-so to make her give up this matter: “Younger sister, don’t live closely together with a householder or a householder’s child, and engage in practices not to be followed. Younger sister, please live apart. If you live apart, you’ll grow in the Buddha’s dhamma and live comfortably.” This is the motion.’

<lzh>『大姊僧聽！此某甲比丘尼，親近居士、居士兒共住作不隨順行。餘比丘尼諫言：「妹！莫親近居士、居士兒共住作不隨順行。汝，妹！今可別住，汝若別住，於佛法有增益安樂住。」而彼故不改。今僧與彼某甲比丘尼作呵責，捨此事故：「汝，妹！莫親近居士、居士兒共住作不隨順行。汝，妹！可別住，汝若別住者，於佛法有增益安樂住。」誰諸大姊忍僧與彼某甲比丘尼作呵責捨此事者默然，誰不忍者說。』如是第二、第三說。『僧已忍與彼比丘尼作呵責捨此事竟，僧忍，默然故，是事如是持。』當作如是呵責。」眾僧為彼比丘尼作呵責，白四羯磨捨此事已。諸比丘尼往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白佛，</lzh>
‘Venerable sisters, may the sangha listen. This bhikkhunī So-and-so lives closely together with a householder and a householder’s child, and engages in practices not to be followed. The other bhikkhunīs admonished her: “Younger sister, don’t live closely together with a householder or a householder’s child, and engage in practices not to be followed. Younger sister, please live apart now. If you live apart, you’ll grow in the Buddha’s dhamma and live comfortably.” But she did as before and didn’t change. The sangha now carries out the criticism for bhikkhunī So-and-so to give up this matter: “Younger sister, don’t live closely together with a householder or a householder’s child, and engage in practices not to be followed. Younger sister, please live apart. If you live apart, you’ll grow in the Buddha’s dhamma and live comfortably.” Those of the venerable sisters who accept that the sangha carries out the criticism for this bhikkhunī So-and-so to give up this matter should remain silent. Those who don’t accept this should speak.’ The second and the third should be recited likewise. ‘The sangha has accepted to carry out the criticism for that bhikkhunī to give up this matter. The sangha accepts this, therefore you’re silent. This matter is remembered thus.’ 


<h2>Origin Story (continued)</h2>


You should carry out the criticism in this way.” When the sangha had carried out the formal act of criticism with a motion as fourth for that bhikkhunī to give up this matter, the bhikkhunīs went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the Buddha. 

<lzh>佛告諸比丘：「若有如是比丘尼，比丘尼僧亦當作白四羯磨呵諫捨此事。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，親近居士、居士兒共住作不隨順行。餘比丘尼諫此比丘尼言：『妹！汝莫親近居士、居士兒共住作不隨順行。妹！汝可別住，若別住，於佛法中有增益安樂住。』彼比丘尼諫此比丘尼時堅持不捨，彼比丘尼應三諫捨此事故。乃至三諫捨此事善；若不捨者，波逸提。」</lzh>
The Buddha said to the bhikkhus: “If there’s such a bhikkhunī (again), the bhikkhunī sangha should also carry out a formal act of criticism and admonishment with a motion as fourth to make her give up this matter. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī lives closely together with a householder or a householder’s child, and engages in practices not to be followed, the other bhikkhunīs should admonish that bhikkhunī: “Younger sister, don’t live closely together with a householder or a householder’s child, and engage in practices not to be followed. Younger sister, please live apart. If you live apart, you’ll grow in the Buddha’s dhamma and live comfortably.” If when the bhikkhunīs admonish that bhikkhunī, she holds firmly on to it and doesn’t give it up, the bhikkhunīs should admonish her three times to give up this matter. If she gives it up by the third time, it’s fine. If not, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>親近者，數數語、數數笑、數數調戲。</lzh>
“Closely” means often talking, often laughing, often amusing oneself.

<lzh>居士者，未出家人。</lzh>
“A householder” means a person who hasn’t yet gone forth.

<lzh>兒者，亦未出家人。</lzh>
“Child” also means a person who hasn’t yet gone forth.

<lzh>彼比丘尼，親近彼居士、居士兒共住作不隨順行。彼比丘尼諫此比丘尼言：「妹！莫親近居士、居士兒作不隨順行。汝當別住，汝若別住，於佛法中有增益安樂住。汝今可捨此事，莫為僧所呵責而犯重罪。」若隨語者善，不隨語者當作白。白已當語言：「妹！我已白，餘有羯磨在。可捨此事，莫為僧所呵責而更犯罪。」若隨語者善，不隨語者當作初羯磨。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī lives closely together with a householder or a householder’s child, and engages in practices not to be followed, the bhikkhunīs (should) admonish that bhikkhunī: “Younger sister, don’t live closely together with a householder or a householder’s child, and engage in practices not to be followed. Please live apart. If you live apart, you’ll grow in the Buddha’s dhamma and live comfortably. Please give up this matter now. When you’re criticized by the sangha, don’t commit a grave<note> “grave” seems to have been carried over by mistake from the pārājikas and saṅghādisesas. Pācittiyas are not grave offenses. Further down, the text doesn’t mention “grave” anymore.</note> offense.” If she follows this advice, it’s good. If not, the motion should be carried out. When the motion has been carried out, they should say: “Younger sister, we’ve done the motion, the announcements are still left. Please give up this matter. When you’re criticized by the sangha, don’t commit an offense.” If she follows this advice, it’s good. If not, the first announcement should be carried out. 

<lzh>作初羯磨已當語言：「妹！已白已作初羯磨，餘有二羯磨在。可捨此事，莫為僧所呵責而更犯罪。」若隨語者善，不隨語者作第二羯磨。作第二羯磨已當語言：「已作白第二羯磨，餘有一羯磨在。可捨此事，莫為僧所呵責而更犯罪。」若隨語者善，不隨語者作三羯磨竟，波逸提。若白二羯磨竟，三突吉羅。白一羯磨竟，二突吉羅。白已，一突吉羅。白未竟、未白前，親近居士、居士兒作不隨順行，如是一切突吉羅。</lzh>
When the first announcement has been carried out, they should say: “Younger sister, we’ve done the motion and carried out the first announcement, two announcements are still left. Please give up this matter. When you’re criticized by the sangha, don’t commit an offense.” If she follows this advice, it’s good. If not, the second announcement should be carried out. When the second announcement has been carried out, they should say: “We’ve carried out the motion and two announcements, one announcement is still left. Please give up this matter. When you’re criticized by the sangha, don’t commit an offense.” If she follows this advice, it’s good. If not, when third announcement has been carried out, it’s a pācittiya. (If she gives it up) after the motion and two announcements, it’s three dukkaṭas. After the motion and one announcement, it’s two dukkaṭas. After the motion, it’s one dukkaṭa. When motion hasn’t yet been done, and when, before the motion, she lives closely together with a householder or a householder’s child, and engages in practices not to be followed, in all such cases it’s a dukkaṭa. 

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，初語時捨、非法別眾呵責，非法和合眾、法別眾、似法別眾、似法和合眾，非法非律非佛所教，若一切不作呵責，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she gives it up when first spoken to; if they criticize her against the dhamma in a divided assembly; against the dhamma in a harmonious assembly; according to dhamma in a divided assembly; with what resembles dhamma in a divided assembly; with what resembles dhamma in a harmonious assembly; if they instruct her against the dhamma and vinaya, against the Buddha’s teaching; and if the criticism hasn’t been carried out at all, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 99th rule.)
