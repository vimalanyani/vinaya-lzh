<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時偷羅難陀比丘尼，同活比丘尼病而不瞻視。諸比丘尼語言：「汝同活比丘尼病，何不看視？」彼猶故不瞻視，以不瞻視故彼遂命過。</lzh>
Then Thullanandā bhikkhunī didn’t look after the sick bhikkhunī who lived with her. The other bhikkhunīs said: “The bhikkhunī who lives with you is sick. Why don’t you look after her?” She still didn’t look after her, and because of not being looked after, the other passed away.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責偷羅難陀比丘尼：「汝云何同活比丘尼病而不瞻視？諸比丘尼勸汝，而不從語瞻視，遂令命終。」時諸比丘尼往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊爾時以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責偷羅難陀比丘尼：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何偷羅難陀比丘尼，同活比丘尼病而不瞻視？諸比丘尼勸汝看視，而不從語，遂令命終。」時世尊以無數方便呵責偷羅難陀比丘尼已，告諸比丘：「此偷羅難陀比丘尼！多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼同活比丘尼病，不瞻視者，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked Thullanandā bhikkhunī: “Why didn’t you look after the sick bhikkhunī who lives with you? The bhikkhunīs instructed you, but you didn’t follow their words and look after her, so that she has passed away.” Then the bhikkhunīs went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized Thullanandā bhikkhunī: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why, Thullanandā bhikkhunī, didn’t you look after the sick bhikkhunī who lives with you? The bhikkhunīs instructed you to look after her, but you didn’t follow their words, so that she has passed away.” Then, when the World-honored One had criticized Thullanandā bhikkhunī in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “This Thullanandā bhikkhunī has all kinds of taints, and is the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī, when another bhikkhunī who lives with her is sick, doesn’t look after her, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>同活者，二比丘尼共生活。</lzh>
“Who lives with her” means that two bhikkhunīs live together.

<lzh>彼比丘尼，同生活比丘尼病，不看視者，波逸提。除同活病，若餘比丘尼病，若和上、若阿闍梨，若同和上、同阿闍梨，若弟子、親厚知識病，不瞻視，一切突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī, when another bhikkhunī who lives with her is sick, doesn’t look after her, it’s a pācittiya. If a bhikkhunī other than the one who lives with her is sick, either her preceptor, or her teacher, or those with the same preceptor, or those with the same teacher, or her students, friends and acquaintances, and she doesn’t look after them, in all cases it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，瞻視同活病、若己身病不堪瞻視病者，若由是故命難或梵行難不看，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she looks after a sick person who lives with her, if she’s sick herself and isn’t able to look after a sick person, if because of this her life would be in danger, or if her celibacy would be in danger and she doesn’t look after her, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 93rd rule.)
