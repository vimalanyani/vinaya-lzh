<h2>First Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時六群比丘尼中有一人，日沒開僧伽藍門出不囑而去。時有賊囚突獄而出，遙見僧伽藍門開便來入。時諸守獄人追後而來，問諸比丘尼：「頗見如是如是賊不？」不見者言：「不見。」其守獄者，即便處處推覓得賊。時諸居士皆共譏嫌：「此比丘尼等，不知慚愧作妄語，外自稱言：『我知正法。』如是有何正法？見賊而言不見。」時諸比丘尼自相問言：「誰日沒開門而出？」報言：「六群比丘尼中一人開門而出。」</lzh>
Then there was someone among the group-of-six bhikkhunīs who opened the monastery gate at sunset and left without informing anyone. Then there was a criminal who had been caught and had escaped from prison. From a distance they saw that the monastery gate was open and they came and entered. Then the prison guards chasing after them came and asked the bhikkhunīs: “Might you have seen such-and-such a criminal?” They hadn’t seen them and said: “We haven’t seen them.” The prison guards then searched everywhere and caught the criminal. Then the householders were all upset: “These bhikkhunīs know no shame, they lie. Outwardly, they praise themselves: ‘We know the true dhamma’, how is that the true dhamma? They saw the criminal but said they hadn’t seen them.” Then the bhikkhunīs asked each other: “Who opened the gate at sunset and left?” Someone replied: “One of the group-of-six bhikkhunīs opened the gate and left.”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，呵責六群比丘尼言：「汝云何日沒輒開門不囑而出？」即白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責六群比丘尼中一人言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何比丘尼，日沒輒開門出不囑而去？」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，日沒開僧伽藍門而出，波逸提。」如是世尊與比丘尼結戒。</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunī: “Why did you just open the gate at sunset without informing anyone and leave?” Then they told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized the bhikkhunī of the group-of-six: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why, bhikkhunī, did you just open the gate at sunset without informing anyone and leave?” When he had criticized her in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “This bhikkhunī has all kinds of taints, and is the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Preliminary Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī opens the monastery gate at sunset and leaves, it’s a pācittiya.’” In this way the World-honored One laid down the precept for the bhikkhunīs.


<h2>Second Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>時諸比丘尼，營佛法僧事、若瞻視病事，疑不敢去。佛言：「自今已後聽囑授去。自今已去當如是說戒：若比丘尼，日沒開僧伽藍門不囑而出者，波逸提。」</lzh>
Then the bhikkhunīs attended to matters of the Buddha, the dhamma, and the sangha, or they looked after the sick. They had doubts and didn’t dare to leave. The Buddha said: “From now on, I allow to inform someone and leave. From now on, you should recite the precept like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī opens the monastery gate at sunset and leaves without informing anyone, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼，日沒開僧伽藍門不囑出門，波逸提。一脚在內、一脚在外，方便欲去而不去，共期去而不去，一切突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī opens the monastery gate at sunset and goes through the gate without informing anyone, it’s a pācittiya. If she has one foot inside and one foot outside, if she plans and wishes to go but doesn’t go, or if she makes an appointment to go but doesn’t go, all cases are dukkaṭas.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，或為佛法僧事，或瞻視病事，若囑而出，或彼僧伽藍破壞，或為火所燒，或為賊或有惡獸毒蛇在中，或為強力者所執，或為繫縛將去，或命難、梵行難，不囑而去者，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she attends to matters of the Buddha, the dhamma, and the sangha, or if she looks after the sick, and she informs someone and leaves, if the monastery is destroyed, if it’s on fire, if there’s a criminal, a savage animal, or a poisonous snake inside, if she’s held by force, if she’s arrested and made to go, if her life is in danger, or if her celibacy is in danger, and she leaves without informing anyone, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 163rd rule.)
