<h2>First Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時佛在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Buddha was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時有比丘尼，度他乳兒婦女，留兒在家，後家中送兒還之，此比丘尼抱兒入村乞食。時諸居士見已皆共譏嫌言：「此比丘尼，不知慚愧犯不淨行。外自稱言：『我修正法。』如是何有正法？看此出家人生兒抱行乞食。」</lzh>
Then there was a bhikkhunī who ordained a breast-feeding woman. She had left the baby at home, and later the family sent the baby back to her. This bhikkhunī held them in her arms, and entered the village on almsround. When the householders saw this, they were all upset and said: “This bhikkhunī knows no shame, she has committed impure practices. Outwardly, she praises herself: ‘I know the true dhamma’, how is that the true dhamma? Look at this renunciate who has given birth to a baby, and holds them when she walks on almsround.”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，呵責彼比丘尼言：「汝云何乃度他乳兒婦女令諸居士譏嫌？」往白諸比丘，諸比丘白佛。佛以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責彼比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何度他乳兒婦女？」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼度他乳兒婦女受具足戒，波逸提。」如是世尊與比丘尼結戒。</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They criticized this bhikkhunī: “Why did you ordain a woman who is breast-feeding a baby, which made the householders upset?” They went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus told the Buddha. The Buddha for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha and criticized this bhikkhunī: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you ordain a woman who is breast-feeding a baby?” When he had criticized her in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “This bhikkhunī has all kinds of taints, and is the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Preliminary Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī gives the full ordination to a woman who is breast-feeding a baby, it’s a pācittiya.’” In this way the World-honored One laid down the precept for the bhikkhunīs.


<h2>Second Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>時諸比丘尼，不知產乳不產乳，後乃知產乳。「不知者無犯。自今已去當如是說戒：若比丘尼，知婦女乳兒，與授具足戒，波逸提。」</lzh>
Then the bhikkhunīs didn’t know who had given birth and was breast-feeding and who wasn’t, and they only found out later that someone had given birth and was breast-feeding. (The Buddha said:) “If you don’t know, there’s no offense. From now on, you should recite the precept like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī knows that a woman is breast-feeding a baby and gives her the full ordination, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼，知他婦女有乳兒，度授具足戒，作三羯磨竟，和上尼，波逸提。白二羯磨竟，三突吉羅。白一羯磨竟，二突吉羅。白竟，一突吉羅。白未竟，突吉羅。未白前與剃髮、與出家、與著衣、與授戒，若集眾眾滿，一切突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī knows that a woman is breast-feeding a baby and gives her the full ordination, when they’ve carried out the three announcements, the preceptor commits a pācittiya. When they’ve carried out the motion and two announcements, it’s three dukkaṭas. When they’ve carried out the motion and one announcement, it’s two dukkaṭas. When they’ve carried out the motion, it’s one dukkaṭa. If the motion hasn’t yet been finished, it’s a dukkaṭa. If they haven’t yet done the motion, when they shave her head, when they give her the going-forth, when she puts on the robes, when they give her the (sāmaṇerī) precepts, when they gather the sangha, or when the assembly is complete, in all cases it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，若不知，信彼人言、信可信人言、或信父母語，而度與授具足戒已，後送兒來，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she doesn’t know, if she believes that person’s words, if she believes a trustworthy person’s words, if she believes her parents’ words, and when she has given her the full ordination, (the new bhikkhunī) later sends for her child to come, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>其母疑不敢抱養。佛言：「若未能自活，聽如母法乳養至斷乳止。」後母與此兒同處宿有疑。佛言：「自今已去聽未斷乳者無犯。」</lzh>
The mother had doubts and didn’t dare to hold and feed (the baby boy). The Buddha said: “If he can’t yet live by himself, I allow to breast-feed him as a mother does until he is weaned.” Later, the mother had doubts about staying overnight in the same room as the baby. The Buddha said: “From now on, I allow it if he’s not yet weaned.” Then the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 120th rule.)
