<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時有比丘尼，著他僧伽梨，不語主入村乞食。時衣主不知，作失衣意，於後求覓，乃見彼比丘尼著行。即語：「汝犯偷。」彼言：「我不偷汝衣，以親厚意故，取汝衣著耳。」</lzh>
Then there was a bhikkhunī who wore someone else’s saṅghāṭī and without telling the owner entered the village on almsround. Then the owner of the robe didn’t know about it, and thought she had lost the robe. Later she searched for it and saw that bhikkhunī walking around wearing it. Then she said: “You committed a theft.” The other said: “I didn’t steal your robe. I thought we were friends, therefore I took your robe and wore it.”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，呵責此比丘尼言：「汝云何不語主盜著他衣，使他作失衣意求覓耶？」即往白諸比丘，諸比丘白佛。佛以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責此比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何比丘尼，不語主盜著他衣，使衣主作失衣意求覓耶？」時世尊以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼不問主便著他衣者，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They criticized this bhikkhunī: “Why did you, without telling the owner, steal and wear her robe, which made her think she had lost it and search for it?” Then they went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus told the Buddha. The Buddha for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized this bhikkhunī: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why, bhikkhunī, did you without telling the owner, steal and wear her robe, which made her think she had lost it and search for it?” When the World-honored One had criticized her in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “This bhikkhunī has all kinds of taints, and is the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī, without asking the owner, just wears her robe, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼取他衣著，不語主入村乞食者，波逸提。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī takes someone else’s robe and wears it, and without telling the owner enters the village on almsround, it’s a pācittiya.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，若問主、若是親厚、若親厚語言：「汝但著，我當為汝語主。」不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she asks the owner, if it’s a friend, or if a friend says: “Just wear it, I’ll tell the owner for you,” the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 106th rule.)
