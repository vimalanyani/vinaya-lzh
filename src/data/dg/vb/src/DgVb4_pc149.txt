<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時提舍比丘尼，是安隱比丘尼弟子，彼有知舊檀越家。安隱比丘尼語提舍比丘尼言：「可共往至檀越家。」報言：「欲往可爾。」二人俱往。安隱比丘尼衣服齊整不失威儀，檀越見已生歡喜心，以此歡喜心便與供養。時安隱比丘尼食後還至僧伽藍中，語提舍比丘尼言：「此檀越篤信歡喜好施供養。」時提舍比丘尼有嫉妬心，便作是語：「檀越篤信好施供養於汝。」</lzh>
Then Tissā bhikkhunī was Khemā bhikkhunī’s student. She knew a family of old supporters. Khemā bhikkhunī said to Tissā bhikkhunī: “Can we go together to the supporter’s house?” She replied: “If you want to go, it’s okay.” So the two people went together. Khemā bhikkhunī’s robes were neat and she didn’t lose proper conduct. When the supporters saw her, they were very happy, and because they were happy, they provided support. When Khemā bhikkhunī had eaten, they returned to the monastery, and she said to Tissā bhikkhunī: “These supporters were devoted and happy, and provided good support.” Then Tissā bhikkhunī got jealous and said: “These supporters were devoted and provided good support to you.”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，呵責提舍比丘尼言：「云何生嫉妬心，乃作是言：『是檀越篤信好施供養於汝。』」即白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責提舍比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何乃生嫉妬心言：『檀越篤信好施供養於汝。』」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼於家生嫉妬心，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They criticized Tissā bhikkhunī: “Why did you get jealous and say: ‘These supporters were devoted and provided good support to you.’?” Then they told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized Tissā bhikkhunī: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you get jealous and say: ‘The supporters were devoted and provided good support to you.’?” When he had criticized her in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “This bhikkhunī has all kinds of taints, and is the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī is jealous regarding families, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼於家生嫉妬心言：「是檀越篤信好施供養於汝。」說而了了者，波逸提；不了了者，突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī is jealous regarding families and says: “These supporters were devoted and provided good support to you,” and if she speaks and others understand, it’s a pācittiya. If they don’t understand, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，其事實爾，若彼檀越篤信好施供養於彼，便作是言：「是汝檀越篤信於汝。」若戲笑語、若疾疾語、若獨語、若夢中語、欲說此乃錯說彼，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if if it’s really true and these supporters were devoted and provided good support to the other, and she says: “Your supporters are devoted to you,” if she says it jokingly, if she speaks quickly, if she speaks when she’s alone, if she speaks in a dream, or if she wants to say one thing but by mistake says something else, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 150th rule.)
