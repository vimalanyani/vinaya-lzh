<h2>First Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時佛在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Buddha was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞佛制戒得度人，輒度小年童女，不知有欲心、無欲心，後便與染污心男子共立共語調戲。</lzh>
Then the bhikkhunīs heard that the Buddha had laid down a precept and allowed to ordain others. So they ordained young girls who didn’t know if they had desire in their minds or not. Later, they stood, talked, and amused themselves together with men with defiled minds.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責諸比丘尼言：「世尊制戒聽度人，汝等云何乃度小年童女，與染污心人共立共語調戲耶？」即白諸比丘，諸比丘往白佛。佛以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責諸比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何乃度小年童女，不知有染污心無染污心，後與染污心人共立共語調戲耶？」以無數方便呵責比丘尼已，告諸比丘尼言：</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked these bhikkhunīs: “The World-honored One has laid down a precept and allowed to ordain others. Why did you then ordain young girls who stand, talk, and amuse themselves together with men with defiled minds?” Then they told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the Buddha. The Buddha for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha and criticized these bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you then ordain young girls who don’t know if they’ve defiled minds or not and later stand, talk, and amuse themselves together with men with defiled minds?” When he had criticized the bhikkhunīs in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhunīs: 

<lzh>「汝等諦聽！若欲在寺內剃髮者，當語一切尼僧令知，若作白已然後與剃髮。當作如是白：『大姊僧聽！此某甲欲從某甲求剃髮，若僧時到僧忍聽，為某甲剃髮。白如是。』作如是白已，然後與剃髮。若欲在寺內與出家者，當語一切尼僧。若作白已與出家，當作如是白：『大姊僧聽！此某甲從某甲求出家，若僧時到僧忍聽，與某甲出家。白如是。』作如是白已，然後與出家。當作如是出家。與剃髮著袈裟已，教右膝著地、合掌作如是語：『我某甲歸依佛、歸依法、歸依僧，我於如來法中求出家，和上尼某甲，如來、至真、等正覺是我世尊。』如是第二、第三說。</lzh>
“Listen carefully. If you want to shave someone’s head inside the monastery, you should inform the whole bhikkhunī sangha to let them know. After you’ve carried out the motion, you may shave the head. You should carry out the motion as follows: 


<h2>Saṅghakamma</h2>

‘Venerable sisters, may the sangha listen. This So-and-so wants to request So-and-so to shave her head. If the right time has come for the sangha, may the sangha approve that So-and-so’s head be shaven. This is the motion.’ 


<h2>First Origin Story (continued)</h2>

After you’ve carried out the motion like this, you may shave the head. If you want to give the going forth to someone inside the monastery, you should inform the whole bhikkhunī sangha. After you’ve carried out the motion, you may give the going forth. You should carry out the motion as follows: 


<h2>Saṅghakamma</h2>

‘Venerable sisters, may the sangha listen. This So-and-so requests the going forth from So-and-so. If the right time has come for the sangha, may the sangha approve to give So-and-so the going forth. This is the motion.’ 


<h2>First Origin Story (continued)</h2>

After you’ve carried out the motion like this, you may give the going forth. You should carry out the going forth as follows: After her head has been shaven and she has put on the monastic robes, you should instruct her to place her right knee on the ground, join her palms, and say: ‘I, So-and-so, take refuge in the Buddha, take refuge in the dhamma, take refuge in the sangha. I request the going forth in the Tathāgata’s teaching. My preceptor is So-and-so. The Tathāgata, accomplished and fully awakened, is my World-honored One.’ The second and the third time should be recited likewise.

<lzh>『我某甲歸依佛竟、歸依法竟、歸依僧竟。我於如來法中求出家，和上尼某甲，如來、至真、等正覺是我世尊。』如是第二、第三說已。次應與授戒。『盡形壽不殺生，是沙彌尼戒，汝能持不？』能持者答言：『能。』『盡形壽不盜，是沙彌尼戒，汝能持不？』能持者答言：『能。』『盡形壽不婬，是沙彌尼戒，汝能持不？』能者答言：『能。』『盡形壽不妄語，是沙彌尼戒，汝能持不？』能者答言：『能。』『盡形壽不飲酒，是沙彌尼戒，汝能持不？』能者答言：『能。』『盡形壽不著華香瓔珞，是沙彌尼戒，汝能持不？』能者答言：『能。』</lzh>
‘I, So-and-so, have taken refuge in the Buddha, have taken refuge in the dhamma, have taken refuge in the sangha. I request the going forth in the Tathāgata’s teaching. My preceptor is So-and-so. The Tathāgata, accomplished and fully awakened, is my World-honored One.’ When she has recited it a second and a third time, then you should give her the precepts: ‘Not to kill living beings for your whole life, this is a sāmaṇerī precept. Can you keep it or not?’ One who can keep it should answer: ‘I can.’ ‘Not to steal for your whole life, this is a sāmaṇerī precept. Can you keep it or not?’ One who can keep it should answer: ‘I can.’ ‘Not to have sex for your whole life, this is a sāmaṇerī precept. Can you keep it or not?’ One who can should answer: ‘I can.’ ‘Not to lie for your whole life, this is a sāmaṇerī precept. Can you keep it or not?’ One who can should answer: ‘I can.’ ‘Not to drink alcohol for your whole life, this is a sāmaṇerī precept. Can you keep it or not?’ One who can should answer: ‘I can.’ ‘Not to wear flowers, perfume, and ornaments for your whole life, this is a sāmaṇerī precept. Can you keep it or not?’ One who can should answer: ‘I can.’ 

<lzh>『盡形壽不歌舞伎樂不得往看，是沙彌尼戒，汝能持不？』能者答言：『能。』『盡形壽不得高廣大床上坐，是沙彌尼戒，汝能持不？』能者答言：『能。』『盡形壽不非時食，是沙彌尼戒，汝能持不？』能者答言：『能。』『盡形壽不得捉金銀錢，是沙彌尼戒，汝能持不？』能者答言：『能。』『是為沙彌尼十戒，盡形壽能持不？』能者答言：『能。』</lzh>
‘Not to sing, dance, play music, and not being allowed to go watch it for your whole life, this is a sāmaṇerī precept. Can you keep it or not?’ One who can should answer: ‘I can.’ ‘You may not sit on high, broad, and large beds for your whole life, this is a sāmaṇerī precept. Can you keep it or not?’ One who can should answer: ‘I can.’ ‘Not to eat at the wrong time for your whole life, this is a sāmaṇerī precept. Can you keep it or not?’ One who can should answer: ‘I can.’ ‘You may not take gold, silver, and money for your whole life, this is a sāmaṇerī precept. Can you keep it or not?’ One who can should answer: ‘I can.’ ‘These are the 10 sāmeṇerī precepts. Can you keep them for your whole life or not?’ One who can should answer: ‘I can.’ 

<lzh>自今已去聽年十八童女二歲學戒，年滿二十得受具足戒，白四羯磨當如是說戒。沙彌尼當詣僧中偏露右肩、脫革屣、禮比丘尼僧足、右膝著地，合掌當作是語：『大姊僧聽！我某甲沙彌尼，今從僧乞二歲學戒，某甲尼為和上，願僧與我二歲學戒，慈愍故。』第二、第三如是說已。沙彌尼應往離聞處著見處已，比丘尼眾中當差堪能羯磨者如上，應作白：『大姊僧聽！彼某甲沙彌尼，今從僧乞二歲學戒，和上尼某甲。</lzh>
From now on, I allow an 18 year old girl to train in the (sikkhamānā) precepts for two years. When she’s 20, she may receive the full ordination in a formal act with a motion as fourth. You should recite the precept as follows: The sāmaṇerī should go into the midst of the sangha, uncover her right shoulder, take off her leather sandals, pay respect at the bhikkhunī sangha’s feet, place her right knee on the ground, join her palms, and say: 


<h2>Saṅghakamma</h2>

‘Venerable sisters, may the sangha listen. I, sāmaṇerī So-and-so, now ask the sangha for the training precepts for two years with bhikkhunī So-and-so as my preceptor. May the sangha give me the training precepts for two years out of compassion.’ 


<h2>First Origin Story (continued)</h2>

When she has recited it a second and a third time, the sāmaṇerī should go to a place out of earshot but within sight. In the bhikkhunī sangha, they should choose a capable person who can carry out formal acts as above. She should carry out the motion: 


<h2>Saṅghakamma</h2>

‘Venerable sisters, may the sangha listen. This sāmaṇerī So-and-so now asks the sangha for the training precepts for two years with So-and-so as her preceptor. 

<lzh>若僧時到僧忍聽，與某甲沙彌尼二歲學戒，和上尼某甲。白如是。』『大姊僧聽！彼某甲沙彌尼，從僧乞二歲學戒，和上尼某甲。今僧與某甲沙彌尼二歲學戒，和上尼某甲。誰諸大姊忍僧與彼某甲沙彌尼二歲學戒，和上尼某甲者默然，不忍者說。是初羯磨。』如是第二、第三說。『眾僧已忍與某甲沙彌尼二歲學戒，和上尼某甲竟，僧忍，默然故，是事如是持。』彼式叉摩那一切戒應學，除自手取食、授食與他。彼二歲學戒已，年滿二十當與授具足戒白四羯磨。</lzh>
If the right time has come for the sangha, may the sangha approve to give sāmaṇerī So-and-so the training precepts for two years with So-and-so as her preceptor. This is the motion.’ ‘Venerable sisters, may the sangha listen. This sāmaṇerī So-and-so asks the sangha for the training precepts for two years with So-and-so as her preceptor. The sangha now gives sāmaṇerī So-and-so the training precepts for two years with So-and-so as her preceptor. Those of the venerable sisters who accept that the sangha gives this sāmaṇerī So-and-so the training precepts for two years, with So-and-so as her preceptor, should remain silent. Those who don’t accept this should speak. This is the first announcement.’ The second and the third should be recited likewise. ‘The sangha has accepted to give sāmaṇerī So-and-so the training precepts for two years, with So-and-so as her preceptor. The sangha accepts this, therefore you’re silent. This matter is remembered thus.’ 


<h2>First Origin Story (continued)</h2>


This sikkhamānā should train in all precepts, except that she can take food with her own hands, and can offer food to others. When she has trained in the precepts for two years and is 20 years old, she should be given the full ordination in a formal act with a motion as fourth.

<lzh>自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，年滿十八童女二歲學戒已，滿二十與授具足戒。若比丘尼年減二十受具足戒者，波逸提。」如是世尊與比丘尼結戒。</lzh>
From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Preliminary Ruling</h2>

‘When an 18 year old girl has trained for two years in the precepts, a bhikkhunī may give her the full ordination when she’s 20. If a bhikkhunī gives the full ordination to someone below 20, it’s a pācittiya.’” In this way the World-honored One laid down the precept for the bhikkhunīs.


<h2>Second Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>時諸比丘尼，不知滿二十不滿二十，後方知不滿二十或作波逸提懺、或有疑者。「不知者不犯。自今已去當如是結戒：若比丘尼，知年不滿二十，與授具足戒，波逸提。」</lzh>
Then the bhikkhunīs didn’t know who was 20 and who wasn’t, and they only found out later that someone wasn’t 20. Some among them confessed a pācittiya. Some had doubts. (The Buddha said:) “If you don’t know, there’s no offense. From now on, you should recite the precept like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī knows that someone isn’t yet 20 and gives her the full ordination, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼知年不滿二十授具足戒，三羯磨竟，和上尼，波逸提。白二羯磨竟，三突吉羅。白一羯磨，二突吉羅。白已，一突吉羅。白未竟，一突吉羅。若未白前集眾眾滿，一切突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī knows that someone isn’t 20 years old and gives her the full ordination, when they’ve carried out the three announcements, the preceptor commits a pācittiya. When they’ve carried out the motion and two announcements, it’s three dukkaṭas. When they’ve carried out the motion and one announcement, it’s two dukkaṭas. When they’ve carried out the motion, it’s one dukkaṭa. If the motion hasn’t yet been finished, it’s a dukkaṭa. If they haven’t yet done the motion, when they gather the sangha, or when the assembly is complete, in all cases it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，年滿十八、二歲學戒、滿二十受具足戒，若不知、若自言滿二十，若信可信人語，若信父母語。若受戒後疑，當數胎中月，當數閏月，數十四日說戒日，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if the 18 year-old has trained for two years in the precepts and she gives her the full ordination when she’s 20, if she doesn’t know, if (the girl) says herself that she’s 20, if (the bhikkhunī) believes a trustworthy person’s words, or if she believes her parents’ words. If she gives her the full ordination and later has doubts, she should count the months in the womb, the intercalary months, and the 14-day uposatha days, and the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 121st rule.)
