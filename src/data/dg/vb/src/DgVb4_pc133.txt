<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼愚癡不堪教授，從眾僧求授人具足戒。諸比丘尼諫言：「妹止！勿從眾僧求授人具足戒。」彼以從眾僧求授人具足戒不得故，便言：「諸比丘尼有愛、有恚、有怖、有癡，所愛者便聽，不愛者便不聽。」</lzh>
Then bhikkhunīs who were ignorant and incapable of instructing asked the sangha for the Giving-of-full-ordination. The other bhikkhunīs admonished them: “Younger sisters, enough! Don’t ask the sangha for the Giving-of-full-ordination.” Because they asked the sangha for the Giving-of-full-ordination and didn’t receive it, they said: “The bhikkhunīs have desire, anger, fear, and delusion. They approve it for people they like, and don’t approve it for people they don’t like.”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責諸比丘尼：「汝等云何愚癡從僧乞授人具足戒，諸比丘尼諫言：『汝妹止！勿求眾僧授人具足戒。』云何便言：『諸比丘尼有愛、有恚、有怖、有癡，愛者便聽，不愛者便不聽。』」即白諸比丘，諸比丘白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責諸比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何汝等愚癡從僧乞授人具足戒，諸比丘尼諫言：『汝妹止！勿求眾僧乞授人具足戒。』便言：『諸比丘尼有愛、有恚、有怖、有癡。所愛者便聽，不愛者不聽。』」世尊以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked these bhikkhunīs: “Why did you, who are ignorant, ask the sangha for the Giving-of-full-ordination and when the other bhikkhunīs admonished you: ‘Younger sisters, enough! Don’t ask the sangha for the Giving-of-full-ordination’, why did you say: ‘The bhikkhunīs have desire, anger, fear, and delusion. They approve it for people they like, and don’t approve it for people they don’t like.’?” Then they told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha and criticized these bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you, who are ignorant, ask the sangha for the Giving-of-full-ordination and when the other bhikkhunīs admonished you: ‘Younger sisters, enough! Don’t ask the sangha for the Giving-of-full-ordination’, say: ‘The bhikkhunīs have desire, anger, fear, and delusion. They approve it for people they like, and don’t approve it for people they don’t like.’?” When the World-honored One had criticized them in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: 

<lzh>「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，僧不聽授人具足戒，便言：『眾僧有愛、有恚、有怖、有癡。欲聽者便聽，不欲聽者便不聽。』波逸提。」</lzh>
“These bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī, whom the sangha hasn’t approved to give the full ordination to someone, says: “The sangha has greed, anger, fear, and delusion. When they want to approve it, they approve it. When they don’t want to approve it, they don’t,” it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>僧者如上。</lzh>
“Sangha” is as above.

<lzh>不聽者，眾僧語言：「妹止！不須授人具足戒。」</lzh>
“Not approved” means the sangha has said: “Younger sister, enough! There’s no need to give the full ordination to people.”

<lzh>彼以不得授人具足戒故，便言：「諸比丘尼有愛、有恚、有怖、有癡。所愛者便聽，不愛者便不聽。」若說而了了者，波逸提；不了了者，突吉羅。</lzh>
If she, because she doesn’t receive the Giving-of-full-ordination, says: “The bhikkhunīs have greed, anger, fear, and delusion. They approve it for people they like, and don’t approve it for people they don’t like,” and if she speaks and the others understand, it’s a pācittiya. If they don’t understand, it’s a dukkaṭa.”

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，其事實爾，有愛、有恚、有怖、有癡，愛者便聽、不愛者不聽。彼人便作是語：「有愛、有恚、有怖、有癡，愛者便聽、不愛者不聽。」若戲笑語、疾疾語、屏處語、若夢中語、欲說此乃錯說彼，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if it’s really true and they’ve greed, anger, fear, and delusion, and they approve it for people they like, and don’t approve it for people they don’t like, and someone says: “They’ve greed, anger, fear, and delusion. They approve it for people they like, and don’t approve it for people they don’t like,” if she says it jokingly, if she speaks quickly, if she speaks in a secluded place, if she speaks in a dream, or if she wants to say one thing but by mistake says something else, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 133rd rule.)
