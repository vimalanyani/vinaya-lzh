<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時六群比丘尼，入村在屏處與男子共立語。諸居士見皆共譏嫌言：「此比丘尼，不知慚愧、犯不淨行，外自稱言：『我知正法。』如是有何正法？入村與男子屏處共語，如婬女賊女無異。」</lzh>
Then the group-of-six bhikkhunīs entered a village, and stood and spoke together with men in a secluded place. When the householders saw it, they were all upset and said: “These bhikkhunīs know no shame and they commit impure practices. Outwardly, they praise themselves: ‘We know the true dhamma’, how is that the true dhamma? They enter the village, and speak with men in a secluded place. There’s no difference to prostitutes and criminals.” 

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責六群比丘尼：「汝等云何入村在屏處與男子共立語？」時諸比丘尼往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊爾時以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責六群比丘尼：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何汝等入村屏處與男子共立語？」時世尊以無數方便呵責六群比丘尼已，告諸比丘：「此六群比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，入村內與男子在屏處共立共語，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “Why did you enter a village, and stand and speak together with men in a secluded place?” Then the bhikkhunīs went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you enter a village, and stand and speak together with men in a secluded place?” Then, when the World-honored One had criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These group-of-six bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī enters a village, and stands and speaks together with a man in a secluded place, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>村者，白衣舍。</lzh>
“A village” means lay homes.

<lzh>屏處者，不見、不聞處。不見處者，若塵霧闇。不聞處者，乃至不聞常語聲。</lzh>
“A secluded place” means a place out of sight and earshot. “A place out of sight” means because of dust or fog or darkness. “A place out of earshot” means down to not hearing the sound of normal speech.

<lzh>若比丘尼，入村內與男子在屏處立共語，波逸提。若同伴盲而不聾，突吉羅。聾而不盲，突吉羅。立而不語，突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī enters a village, and stands and speaks together with a man in a secluded place, it’s a pācittiya. If she’s with a companion who is blind but not deaf, it’s a dukkaṭa. If she’s deaf but not blind, it’s a dukkaṭa. If they stand but don’t speak, it’s a dukkaṭa. 

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，若二比丘尼為伴，若有可知人為伴，若有多女人共立，或不盲不聾，或行不住，或病倒地，或為強力者所執，或被縛將去，或命難、或梵行難，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if there are two bhikkhunīs as companions, if she has a knowledgeable person as companion, if many women stand together who aren’t blind and not deaf, if she walks and doesn’t stay, if she’s sick and falls to the ground, if she’s held by force, if she’s arrested and made to go, if her life is in danger, or if her celibacy is in danger, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 80th rule.)

<lzh>(八十竟)</lzh>
