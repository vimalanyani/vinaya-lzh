<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時世尊在毘舍離獼猴江側，在樓閣堂上。時有離奢婦女出外遊戲，時有賊女在是眾中共行，伺其作樂戲時偷彼財物逃走。時諸婦女遣使往告離奢：「此有賊女取我財物走去，願與我求覓。」時諸離奢遣人求覓，得便當殺之。時賊女聞此語：「遣人求覓得便殺。」即捨毘舍離逃走，詣王舍城，至比丘尼僧伽藍中，語諸尼言：「我有信心貪樂出家。」諸尼聞已，即便度出家受具足戒。時諸離奢聞，此賊女逃走詣王舍城，即往告摩竭國瓶沙王：「此有賊女，取我婦女財物逃走來此，願王與我求覓。」時洴沙王即勅左右檢校求之。左右白王言：「有賊女，已在尼僧伽藍中出家為道。」時洴沙王聞有賊女來此，比丘尼已度出家為道。即遣信語諸離奢：「聞有賊女在尼僧伽藍中已出家為道，我不能語。」時諸離奢皆共譏嫌言：「諸比丘尼，不知慚愧，皆是賊女，外自稱言：『我知正法。』云何度他賊女，其罪應死，多人所知，度令出家受具足戒。如是何有正法？」</lzh>
At that time, the World-honored One was in Vesālī, in the hall with the peaked roof near the monkey pond. Then, some Licchavi women went out to enjoy themselves, and a female criminal was going with them in their group. She waited until they were amusing themselves, and then stole their valuables and ran away. The Licchavi women sent a messenger to tell the Licchavis: “There was a female criminal here who took our valuables and ran away. Please search her for us.” Then the Licchavis sent out people to search for her, and allowed to kill her. When the female criminal heard this report: “They sent out people to search, and allowed them to kill her,” she fled from Vesālī, and went to Rājagaha. She reached the bhikkhunī monastery, and said to the bhikkhunīs: “I’ve faith and desire to go forth.” When the bhikkhunīs heard this, they gave her the going forth and the full ordination. When the Licchavis heard that this female criminal had fled and gone to Rājagaha, they went and told king Bimbisāra of Magadha: “There’s a female criminal here who has taken our wives’ valuables, ran away, and came here. Please, may the king search her for us.” Then king Bimbisāra ordered his ministers to investigate and search her. The ministers informed the king: “There’s a female criminal who has already gone forth to practise the path in the bhikkhunī monastery.” When king Bimbisāra heard that there was a female criminal who had come there, and that the bhikkhunīs had already given her the going forth to practise the path, he sent a message to the Licchavis: “I heard that the female criminal has already gone forth to practise the path in the bhikkhunī monastery. I can’t say anything.” Then all the Licchavis were upset and said: “These bhikkhunīs know no shame, and they’re all criminals. Outwardly, they praise themselves: ‘We know the true dhamma’, but why did they ordain that female criminal? She should die for her crime, many people knew about it, and they gave her the going forth and the full ordination. How is that the true dhamma?”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責彼比丘尼：「汝云何度賊女令出家為道？」時諸比丘尼白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集諸比丘，呵責彼比丘尼：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。知是賊女，云何度令出家受具足戒？」爾時世尊以無數方便呵責彼比丘尼已，告諸比丘：「是比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，度他賊女應死者，多人所知，度令出家受具足戒，是比丘尼犯初法應捨，僧伽婆尸沙。」如是世尊與比丘尼結戒。</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked that bhikkhunī: “Why did you give the going forth to practise the path to a female criminal?” Then the bhikkhunīs told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized that bhikkhunī: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. You knew that she’s a criminal. Why did you give her the going forth and the full ordination?” Then, when the World-honored One had criticized this bhikkhunī in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “That bhikkhunī has all kinds of taints, and is the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: ‘If a bhikkhunī ordains a female criminal who should die, whom many people know about, and she gives her the going forth and the full ordination, that bhikkhunī commits an immediate offense that should be given up, a saṅghādisesa.’” In this way, the World-honored One laid down the precept for the bhikkhunīs.

<lzh>彼城中作賊出外村，外村作賊入城內。時諸比丘尼，不知賊與不賊、應死不應死、人知不知，後乃知是賊、應死、人所知，或有言犯僧伽婆尸沙，或疑。佛言：「不知者不犯。自今已去當如是說戒：若比丘尼，先知是賊女、罪應死、人所知，不問王大臣、不問種姓，便度出家受具足戒，是比丘尼犯初法應捨，僧伽婆尸沙。」</lzh>
Someone stole in the city and went to a village, someone stole in a village and entered the city. Then the bhikkhunīs didn’t know if someone was a criminal or not, whether she should die or not, whether people knew about her or not, and they only found out later that she was a criminal, that she should die, and that people knew about her. Some said that they had committed a saṅghādisesa. Some had doubts. The Buddha said: “If you don’t know, there’s no offense. From now on, you should recite the precept like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī previously knows that a woman is a criminal, sentenced to death, whom people know about, and she, without asking the king, a high official, or (the woman’s) clan, gives her the going forth and the higher ordination, that bhikkhunī commits an immediate offense that should be given up, a saṅghādisesa.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>賊者，若盜五錢、若過五錢。</lzh>
“A criminal” means she has stolen five coins, or more than five coins.

<lzh>應死者，處在死中也。</lzh>
“She should die” means she has been placed among the dead.

<lzh>多人知者，王所知、大臣所知、庶民共知。</lzh>
“Many people know about” means the king knows, a high official knows, and the common people know.

<lzh>王者，不依人食。</lzh>
“A king” means someone who doesn’t depend on people for food.

<lzh>大臣者，受王重位佐理國事。</lzh>
“A high official” means someone who has received a high rank from the king and assists in managing the country’s affairs.

<lzh>種姓者，舍夷、拘離彌寧、跋耆、滿羅蘇摩。</lzh>
“A clan” means the Sakyans, the Koliyans, the Macchas, the Vajjis, the Mallas, or the Sumanas.

<lzh>彼比丘尼，知賊女、罪應死、多人所知，不問王、大臣、種姓，便度為道。作三羯磨竟，和上尼僧伽婆尸沙。若作白二羯磨竟，三偷羅遮。白一羯磨竟，二偷羅遮。白竟，一偷羅遮。若白未竟，突吉羅。若未白前，若與剃髮，若與出家與受戒集眾僧，一切突吉羅。眾滿，亦突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī knows that she’s a female criminal, sentenced to death, whom many people know about, and she, without asking the king, a high official, or her clan, ordains her to practise the path, when they’ve carried out the three announcements, the preceptor commits a saṅghādisesa. When they’ve carried out the motion and two announcements, they’re three thullaccayas. When they’ve carried out the motion and one announcement, they’re two thullaccayas. When they’ve carried out the motion, it’s one thullaccaya. If the motion hasn’t been finished yet, it’s a dukkaṭa. If they haven’t done the motion yet, when they shave her head, or when they gather the sangha to give the going forth and the full ordination, in all cases it’s a dukkaṭa. When the assembly is complete, it’s also a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，若不知，或白王大臣種姓，若罪應死王聽出家，若有罪聽出家，若於繫縛中放令出家，若救使得脫，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she doesn’t know, if she informs the king, a high official, or her clan, if (the woman) is sentenced to death but the king allows her to go forth, if she has committed a crime that allows for the going forth, if she’s released from prison to go forth, and if she’s saved and released, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。(五竟)</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the fifth rule.)
