<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在拘睒彌。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Kosambī.

<lzh>時迦羅比丘尼，好喜鬪諍不善憶持鬪諍事，後瞋恚嫌責尼眾。</lzh>
Then Kālī bhikkhunī delighted in quarreling and held on to a dispute without remembering correctly. Later she angrily rebuked the bhikkhunī sangha.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責迦羅比丘尼言：「汝云何喜鬪諍斷已，懷恨經宿嫌罵尼眾耶？」即白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責迦羅言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何喜鬪諍斷已，懷恨經宿方便罵詈尼眾耶？」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，喜鬪諍不善憶持諍，事後瞋恚不喜罵比丘尼眾者，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked Kālī bhikkhunī: “Why did you delight in a quarrel that had already been settled, and still harboring anger when the night had passed, abuse the bhikkhunī sangha?” Then they told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha and criticized Kālī: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you delight in a quarrel that had already been settled, and still harboring anger when the night had passed, make plans to scold the bhikkhunī sangha?” When he had criticized her in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “This bhikkhunī has all kinds of taints, and is the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī delights in quarreling, holds on to a dispute without remembering correctly, and later, angry and dissatisfied, abuses the bhikkhunī sangha, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>諍有四種如上。</lzh>
There are four kinds of quarrels, as above.

<lzh>眾者，若四人若過四人。</lzh>
“Sangha” means four people or more than four.

<lzh>彼比丘尼，喜鬪諍經宿後罵比丘尼眾，說而了了者，波逸提；不了了者，突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī delights in quarreling and when a night has passed, abuses the bhikkhunī sangha, and if she speaks and others understand, it’s a pācittiya. If others don’t understand, it’s a dukkaṭa. 

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，若戲笑語、若疾疾語、若獨語、若夢中語、欲說此乃錯說彼，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she says it jokingly, if she speaks quickly, if she speaks when she’s alone, if she speaks in a dream, or if she wants to say one thing but by mistake says something else, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 146th rule.)
