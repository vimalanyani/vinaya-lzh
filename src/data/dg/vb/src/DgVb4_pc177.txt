<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時六群比丘尼，自莊嚴身梳髮香塗摩身。諸居士見皆共嗤笑言：「我等婦莊嚴其身、梳髮、香塗摩身，此比丘尼亦復如是。」便生慢心不恭敬。</lzh>
Then the group-of-six bhikkhunīs adorned their bodies, combed their hair, and applyed perfume on their bodies. When the householders saw them, they all laughed at them and said: “Our wives adorn their bodies, comb their hair, and apply perfume on their bodies. These group-of-six bhikkhunīs also do all this.” Then pride arose in their minds, and they didn’t respect them anymore. 

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責六群比丘尼言：「汝等出家，云何如是莊嚴其身？」即白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責六群比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何六群比丘尼莊嚴其身？」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，作婦女莊嚴香塗摩身，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “You’ve gone forth. Why did you adorn your bodies like this?” Then they told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why, group-of-six bhikkhunīs, did you adorn your bodies?” When he had criticized them in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī adorns herself as a woman does and applies perfume on her body, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼，作婦女莊嚴香塗摩身乃至一點者，一切波逸提。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī adorns herself as a woman does and applies perfume on her body, even if only one drop, each case is a pācittiya.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，或時有如是病，或時父母得病被繫閉為洗沐梳髮，若有篤信優婆夷遇病被繫閉與洗浴，或為強力者所執，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she has a certain illness at that time, if her parents have become sick or are imprisoned and she washes them and combs their hair, if a devoted lay Buddhist has become sick or is imprisoned and she washes them, or if she’s held by force, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 177th rule.)
