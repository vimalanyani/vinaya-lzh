<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在羅閱祇耆闍崛山中。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Rājagaha on Vulture’s peak.

<lzh>時羅閱城中有一不信樂大臣，有一獨坐床無人敢坐上者。偷羅難陀比丘尼，常入出其家以為檀越。偷羅難陀到時著衣持鉢往詣其家，不語便坐大臣床座上。大臣見已問言：「誰令此比丘尼坐我床上？」答言：「無有語者，自來坐耳。」時大臣譏嫌言：「偷羅難陀比丘尼無有慚愧，外自稱言：『我知正法。』如是有何正法？云何比丘尼，不語主人便坐他座上，如賊女婬女無異。」偷羅難陀坐床上時，有月水不淨，污他床褥即捨而去。大臣見已復更㥲恚言：「此比丘尼不知慚愧，外自稱言：『我知正法。』如是有何正法？不語其主坐他座上，如似婬女賊女有何等異？」</lzh>
Then there was a high official without joyous faith in Rājagaha who had a one-person bench where nobody dared to sit down on. Thullanandā bhikkhunī often went in and out of their house. They were her supporters. When the right time had come, Thullanandā put on her robes, took her bowl, and went to their home. Without telling anyone, she sat on the high official’s bench. When the high official saw her, he asked: “Who has let this bhikkhunī sit on my bench?” They answered: “Nobody has spoken with her. She just came and sat down by herself.” Then the high official was upset and said: “Thullanandā bhikkhunī has no shame. Outwardly, she praises herself: ‘I know the true dhamma’, how is that the true dhamma? Why does a bhikkhunī without telling the owner sit on their seat? There’s no difference to criminals and prostitutes.” When Thullanandā sat on the bench, she had her menses, and when the impurity had soiled his bench and mat, she left and went away. When the high official saw this, he got angry again and said: “This bhikkhunī knows no shame. Outwardly, she praises herself: ‘I know the true dhamma’, how is that the true dhamma? Without telling the owner, she sits on their seat. What’s the difference to prostitutes and criminals?”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責偷羅難陀比丘尼：「云何比丘尼，不語主人輒坐他床上？」時諸比丘尼往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊爾時以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責偷羅難陀比丘尼：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何偷羅難陀比丘尼！不語主人輒坐他床上？」時世尊以無數方便呵責偷羅難陀比丘尼已，告諸比丘：「此偷羅難陀比丘尼！多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼入白衣家內，不語主人輒坐床者，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked Thullanandā bhikkhunī: “Why, bhikkhunī, did you, without speaking to the owner, just sit on their bench?” The bhikkhunīs went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized Thullanandā bhikkhunī: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why, Thullanandā bhikkhunī, did you, without speaking to the owner, just sit on their bench?” Then, when the World-honored One had criticized Thullanandā bhikkhunī in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “This Thullanandā bhikkhunī has all kinds of taints, and is the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī enters a lay house, and without speaking to the owner, just sits on a bench, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼入白衣家，不語主人輒坐床座者，波逸提。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī enters a lay house, and without speaking to the owner, just sits on a bench, it’s a pācittiya.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，語主人而坐，或有常處坐，若是親厚，若有親厚人語言：「汝但坐無苦，我當語主人。」若坐石上、木上、埵上、草敷上，若癲病發臥地，或為強力者所執，或命難、梵行難，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she tells the owner and sits down, if she sits on her regular seat, if they’re friends, if there’s a friend who says: “Just sit down without worries, I’ll tell the owner,” if she sits on a stone, on a log, on the hard ground, or on a layer of grass, if an insanity or illness arises and she lies down on the ground, if she’s held by force, if her life is in danger, or if her celibacy is in danger, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 84th rule.)
