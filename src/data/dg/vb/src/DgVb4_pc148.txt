<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時有一居士欲辦具飲食請比丘尼僧，即於其夜辦種種多美飲食，夜過已清旦往白時到。時舍衛城中俗節會日，諸居士各各持飯、乾飯、麨、魚及肉，來就僧伽藍中，與諸比丘尼。諸比丘尼受此施食食已，然後方詣居士家食。時居士手自斟酌羹飯與諸比丘尼。諸比丘尼言：「止！止！居士，不須多著。」居士報言：「我所以辦具此種種多美飲食人別一器肉者，正為阿姨故耳！勿謂我無有信心而不食。阿姨但食，我實有信心。」比丘尼報言：「我等不以此事，朝是節會日，諸居士各各持飯、麨、乾飯、魚、肉種種羹飯，來詣僧伽藍中，與諸比丘尼。我等先已食，以是故少受耳。」時諸居士皆共譏嫌言：「此比丘尼不知厭足，外自稱言：『我知正法。』如是何有正法？云何先受我請已，復受他種種飯食食已，後方受我食？」</lzh>
Then there was a householder who wanted to prepare a complete meal and drinks and invite the bhikkhunī sangha. The night before, they prepared many kinds of good food and drinks, and when the night had passed, at dawn, they went and informed (the sangha) that the time had come. That day was a worldly holiday in Sāvatthī and many householders took cooked rice, dried cooked rice, flour, fish, or meat and came to the monastery to give it to the bhikkhunīs. The bhikkhunīs accepted these food offerings and ate them. Afterwards, they went to the householder’s home to eat. Then the householder served curries and rice with their own hands to the bhikkhunīs. The bhikkhunīs said: “Enough! Enough! Householder, you don’t need to put much.” The householder replied: “I’ve fully prepared these many kinds of good food and drinks, and a dish of meat for each person, truly just for the venerables! Don’t think I’m a person without faith, and don’t eat. May the venerables just eat, I truly have faith.” The bhikkhunīs replied: “We didn’t think that. This morning was a holiday, and many householders took cooked rice, flour, dried cooked rice, fish, meat, or various kinds of curries and rice, and came to the monastery to give it to the bhikkhunīs. We’ve already eaten earlier, therefore we just accept a little.” Then the householders were all upset and said: “These bhikkhunīs know no moderation. Outwardly, they praise themselves: ‘We know the true dhamma’, how is that the true dhamma? Why have they first accepted our invitation, then again accepted other people’s various kinds of food, and having eaten, they later accepted our food?”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責諸比丘尼言：「汝等云何先受居士請，復受餘食？」即白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責諸比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何先受居士請，後復受餘食耶？」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼先受請，若足食已，後食飯、麨、乾飯、魚及肉者，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked these bhikkhunīs: “Why did you first accept the householder’s invitation and later accept other food?” Then they told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized these bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you first accept the householder’s invitation and later again accept other food?” When he had criticized them in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī has first accepted an invitation, and if she has eaten sufficiently, later eats cooked rice, flour, dried cooked rice, fish, and meat, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼先受請，若足食已，後食他飯、麨、乾飯、魚及肉食，一咽一波逸提。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī has first accepted an invitation, and if she has already eaten sufficiently, later eats someone else’s cooked rice, flour, dried cooked rice, fish, and meat, each mouthful is a pācittiya.’”

<lzh>比丘，波逸提；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，受非正食請，若不滿足食請，若先不被請，若即於食上更得食，若於其家受前食、後食，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she accepts an invitation for what isn’t staple food<note> i.e. an invitation for bhojanīya, not khādanīya.</note>, if she hasn’t eaten sufficiently at the invitation, if she hasn’t first been invited and then still receives more food on top of other food, or if she accepts breakfast and lunch in someone’s home, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 148th rule.)
