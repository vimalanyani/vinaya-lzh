<h2>First Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時六群比丘尼為惱故，先住後至、後至先住，故在前誦經、問義、教授。</lzh>
Then the group-of-six bhikkhunīs intentionally recited suttas, asked for explanations, and taught in front of others who had lived there before when they had arrived later, or who had arrived later when they had lived there before, to irritate them.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責六群比丘尼：「云何汝等為惱故，先住後至、後至先住，在前誦經、問義、教授？」時諸比丘尼往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊爾時以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責六群比丘尼：「云何汝等為惱故，先住後至、後至先住，在前誦經、問義、教授耶？」時世尊以無數方便呵責六群比丘尼已，告諸比丘：「此六群比丘尼！多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼為惱故，先住後至、後至先住，在前誦經、問義、教授，波逸提。」如是世尊與比丘尼結戒。</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “Why did you, when someone had lived there before and you had arrived later, or who arrived later when you had lived there before, recite suttas, ask for explanations, or teach in front of her to irritate her?” Then the bhikkhunīs went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “Why did you, when someone had lived there before and you had arrived later, or who arrived later when you had lived there before, recite suttas, ask for explanations, or teach in front of her to irritate her?” Then, when the World-honored One had criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Preliminary Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī, when someone has lived there before and she has arrived later, or who has arrived later when she has lived there before, recites suttas, asks for explanations, or teaches in front of her to irritate her, it’s a pācittiya.’” In this way the World-honored One laid down the precept for the bhikkhunīs.


<h2>Second Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>彼比丘尼，亦不知是先住非先住、不知後至非後至，後乃知，其中或有作波逸提懺者、或有疑者。「不知者，不犯。自今已去當如是結戒：若比丘尼知先住後至、後至先住，為惱故在前誦經、問義、教授者，波逸提。」</lzh>
The bhikkhunīs also didn’t know who had lived there before and who hadn’t lived there before, and they didn’t know who had arrived later and who hadn’t arrived later. They only found out later. Among them, some confessed a pācittiya, some had doubts. (The Buddha said:) “If you don’t know, there’s no offense. From now on, you should recite the precept like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī knows that someone has lived there before and she has arrived later, or has arrived later when she has lived there before, and she recites suttas, asks for explanations, or teaches in front of her to irritate her, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼知先住後至、後至先住，為惱故在前誦經、問義、教授，說而了了者，波逸提；不了了者，突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī knows that someone has lived there before and she has arrived later, or has arrived later when she has lived there before, and she recites suttas, asks for explanations, or teaches in front of her to irritate her, if she speaks and the other understands, it’s a pācittiya. If the other doesn’t understand, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，若不知、若先聽、若是親厚、若親厚人語言：「汝但教授，我當為汝語。」若先住者從後至者受經，若後至從先住者受誦，若二人共從他受，若彼問此答、若共誦、若戲笑語、若疾疾語、若夢中語、若欲說此乃錯說彼，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she doesn’t know, if the other has allowed it previously, if they’re friends, if her friend says: “Just teach, I’ll tell her,” if the one who has lived there before learns suttas from the one who has arrived later, if the one who has arrived later learns to recite from the one who has lived there before, if both together learn from another, if one asks and the other answers, if they recite together, if she says it jokingly, if she speaks quickly, if she speaks in a dream, or if she wants to say one thing but by mistake says something else, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 92nd rule.)
