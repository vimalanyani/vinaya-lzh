<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時世尊在羅閱城耆闍崛山中。時世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，告諸比丘：「自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼㥲恚不喜，於異分事中取片，非波羅夷比丘尼，以無根波羅夷法謗，欲破彼人梵行。後於異時，若問、若不問，知是異分事中取片，彼比丘尼住㥲恚法故，作如是說。是比丘尼犯初法應捨，僧伽婆尸沙。」(三竟)</lzh>
At that time, the World-honored One was in Rājagaha on Vulture’s peak.

<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī, angry and dissatisfied, takes an aspect of a different matter and slanders a bhikkhunī who hasn’t commited a pārājika with an unfounded pārājika, wishing to destroy her monastic life, and at a later time, whether questioned or not questioned, it becomes known that she has taken an aspect of a different matter and that she said this because she was in a state of anger, that bhikkhunī commits an immediate offense that should be given up, a saṅghādisesa.’” (End of the third rule.)
