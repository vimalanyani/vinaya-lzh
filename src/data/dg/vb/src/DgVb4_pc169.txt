<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時六群比丘尼，學習呪術以自活命。呪術者，或支節呪、剎利呪、或起尸鬼呪、或學知死相知轉禽獸論、卜知眾鳥音聲。</lzh>
Then the group-of-six bhikkhunīs studied magic arts to make a living. “Magic arts” means the magic of parts of the body, the magic of governing, the magic of raising zombies and ghosts, and they trained in the knowledge of the characteristics of death, the knowledge of divination by turning the zodiac, and the knowledge of the sounds of birds.

<lzh>諸比丘尼聞，中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責六群比丘尼言：「汝等云何乃學習如是諸呪術乃至知眾鳥音聲？」即白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責六群比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何比丘尼，學如是諸技術，乃至知眾鳥音聲？」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，學世俗技術以自活命，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “Why did you study magic arts such as … the knowledge of the sounds of birds?” Then they told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha and criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why, bhikkhunīs, did you learn skills such as … the knowledge of the sounds of birds?” When he had criticized them in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī learns worldly skills to make a living, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>技術者，如上說。</lzh>
“Skills” is as explained above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼，習諸技術乃至知眾鳥音聲，說而了了者，波逸提；不了了，突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī learns skills … the knowledge of the sounds of birds, and if she speaks and others understand, it’s a pācittiya. If others don’t understand, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，若學呪腹中虫病，若治宿食不消、若學書學誦、若學世論為伏外道故、若學呪毒為自護不以為活命，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she learns a spell against an illness of bugs inside the stomach, or a spell so that food stored overnight doesn’t go bad, if she learns to write or to recite, if she learns worldly theories to defeat non-Buddhist renunciates, or if she learns magic against poison to protect herself, and she doesn’t make a living with it, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 169th rule.)
