<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時世尊在拘睒彌瞿師羅園中。</lzh>
At that time, the World-honored One was in Kosambī in Ghosita’s park.

<lzh>時迦羅比丘尼與他共鬪諍，不善憶持諍事，便自手搥胸啼哭。</lzh>
Then Kālī bhikkhunī quarreled with others, held on to the dispute without remembering correctly, beat her chest with her own hands, and cried.

<lzh>時比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，呵責迦羅比丘尼：「汝云何與他共鬪諍，自手搥胸啼哭？」時諸比丘尼往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊爾時以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責迦羅比丘尼：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何迦羅比丘尼與他共鬪諍，手搥胸啼哭？」時世尊以無數方便呵責迦羅比丘尼已，告諸比丘：「此迦羅比丘尼！多種有漏處最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼共鬪諍，不善憶持諍事，搥胸啼哭者，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They criticized Kālī bhikkhunī: “Why did you quarrel with others, beat your chest with your own hands, and cry?” Then the bhikkhunīs went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized Kālī bhikkhunī: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why, Kālī bhikkhunī, did you quarrel with others, beat your chest with your hands, and cry?” When the World-honored One had criticized Kālī bhikkhunī in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “This Kālī bhikkhunī has all kinds of taints, and is the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī quarrels with others, holds on to a dispute without remembering correctly, beats her chest, and cries, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼，與他共鬪諍者，有四種諍如上。</lzh>
“If a bhikkhunī quarrels with others” means there are four kinds of quarrels as above.

<lzh>若比丘尼共鬪諍，不善憶持諍事，搥胸啼哭，一搥胸一波逸提。一渧淚墮一波逸提。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī quarrels with others, holds on to a dispute without remembering correctly, beats her chest, and cries, each beating of the chest is a pācittiya, and each falling tear drop is a pācittiya.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，或時有如是病，或食噎而自搥，或因大小便淚出，或因風寒熱淚出，或烟熏淚出，或聞法心生厭離淚出，或眼病著藥淚出，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she has a certain illness at that time, if she chokes on food and beats (her chest), if tears come because of defecating or urinating, if tears come because of wind, cold, or heat, if tears come because of smoke, if she hears the dhamma, disenchantment arises in her mind, and tears come, or if she applies medicine for an illness of the eyes and tears come, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 89th rule.)
