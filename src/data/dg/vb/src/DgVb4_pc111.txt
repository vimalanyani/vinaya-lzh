<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時佛在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Buddha was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park. 

<lzh>時有比丘尼共諍鬪，至偷羅難陀比丘尼所語言：「與我止此鬪諍！」偷羅難陀比丘尼聰明智慧，諍事起能滅，竟不為方便滅此諍事。時彼比丘尼以鬪諍事不得和合，愁憂遂便休道。</lzh>
Then there were bhikkhunīs who quarreled with each other. They went to Thullanandā bhikkhunī and said: “Settle this dispute for us.” Thullanandā bhikkhunī was intelligent and wise, and she was able to settle arisen disputes, but in the end she didn’t use skillful means to settle this dispute. Then those bhikkhunīs didn’t obtain harmony in this dispute. They were distressed and consequently disrobed.

<lzh>時比丘尼眾聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責偷羅難陀言：「云何比丘尼語言：『為我滅諍事！』而竟不為方便滅此諍事，令彼比丘尼，以此諍事不和解，遂便休道耶？」即往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責偷羅難陀：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何竟不與彼和解鬪諍事，使彼休道耶？」時世尊以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此偷羅難陀比丘尼！多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，餘比丘尼語言：『為我滅此諍事！』而不作方便令滅者，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked Thullanandā: “Why did you, when the bhikkhunīs told you: ‘Settle this dispute for us’, in the end not use skillful means to settle it? Because of this, those bhikkhunīs didn’t resolve this disputed matter, and consequently disrobed.” Then they went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized Thullanandā: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you in the end not resolve the dispute for them, which made them disrobe?” When the World-honored One had criticized her in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “This Thullanandā bhikkhunī has all kinds of taints, and is the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī is told by other bhikkhunīs: “Settle this dispute for us,” but doesn’t undertake any skillful action to settle it, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>鬪諍，有四種，如上。</lzh>
There are four kinds of disputes, as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼，語餘比丘尼言：「為我滅此諍事！」而不與方便滅此諍事，波逸提。除鬪諍已，若更有餘小小事諍，不方便滅，突吉羅。若己身鬪諍事，不方便滅，突吉羅。除比丘比丘尼，餘人有鬪諍，不方便滅，突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī is told by other bhikkhunīs: “Settle this dispute for us,” but doesn’t use skillful means to settle it, it’s a pācittiya. If there are small conflicts other than (formal) disputes, and she doesn’t use skillful means to settle them, it’s a dukkaṭa. If she herself quarrels and doesn’t use skillful means to settle it, it’s a dukkaṭa. If they quarrel with people other than bhikkhus and bhikkhunīs and she doesn’t use skillful means to settle it, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，若為滅、若與作方便、若病、若言不行、若彼破戒、破見、破威儀、若被舉、若滅擯、若應滅擯，若以此事有命難、梵行難，不方便滅者，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she settles it, if she undertakes skillful actions, if she’s sick, if she says that she can’t do it, if the others have broken the precepts, or have broken right view, or have broken proper conduct, if they’ve been suspended, have been permanently expelled, or should be permanently expelled, if because of this issue (the first bhikkhunī’s) life is in danger, or her celibacy is in danger, and she doesn’t use skillful means to settle it, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 111th rule.)
