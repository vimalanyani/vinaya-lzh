<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時佛在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。時有眾多比丘尼於露地說戒，有居士見問言：「阿姨！何故露地說戒，無有說戒堂耶？」答言：「無。」「若與堂直，能作堂不？」答言：「能。」即與作說戒堂物。時諸比丘尼便作是念：「我曹說戒時趣得坐處，便坐說戒。比丘尼衣服難得，應具五衣，我今寧可持此物貿衣共分。」即便貿衣共分。後於異時，諸比丘尼故在露地說戒，彼居士見即問言：「何以故在露地說戒，無有堂耶？」答言：「無。」居士言：「我前所與說戒堂物作何等？」答言：「無所作。」復問：「所由不作？」比丘尼語言：「我等作是念：『我趣得坐處便可說戒，比丘尼衣服難得，應具五衣，我等寧可持此物貿衣。』即以此物貿衣共分。」</lzh>
At that time, the Buddha was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park. Then there was a group of bhikkhunīs who recited the precepts outdoors. Householders saw them and asked: “Venerables, why do you recite the precepts outdoors? Don’t you have a precept-recitation hall?” They answered: “No.” “If we give funds for a hall, can you build one?” They answered: “We can.” Then they gave things for building a precept-recitation hall. Then the bhikkhunīs thought: “When we recite the precepts, we quickly obtain a place to sit, and we sit there to recite the precepts. For bhikkhunīs, robes are hard to get, and we should have our five robes complete. We’d better take these things, exchange them for robes, and distribute them.” Then they exchanged them for robes, and distributed them. At a later time, the bhikkhunīs recited the precepts outdoors as before. Those householders saw them and then asked: “Why do you recite the precepts outdoors? Don’t you have a hall?” They answered: “No.” The householders said: “What did you do with the things we previously gave you for a precept-recitation hall?” They answered: “We didn’t do anything with them.” They asked again: “Why didn’t you do anything?” The bhikkhunīs said: “We thought: ‘We quickly obtain a place to sit where we can recite the precepts. For bhikkhunīs, robes are hard to get, and we should have our five robes complete. We’d better take these things and exchange them for robes.’ Then we exchanged these things for robes, and distributed them.” 

<lzh>時彼居士譏嫌言：「此比丘尼等不知慚愧、受取無厭，外自稱言：『我知正法。』如是有何正法？以我堂物貿衣共分，謂我不知衣服難得當具五衣耶？如佛所說，能造第一福者，作好房施四方僧。」是時諸比丘尼聞，中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，呵責彼比丘尼：「云何汝等，居士施作說戒堂物而貿衣共分？」諸比丘尼白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊爾時以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責彼比丘尼：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何比丘尼以居士作堂物貿衣共分？」時世尊以無數方便呵責彼比丘尼已，告諸比丘：「彼比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，知檀越所為僧施異，迴作餘用者，尼薩耆波逸提。」</lzh>
Then those householders were upset and said: “These bhikkhunīs know no shame, they take without limit. Outwardly, they praise themselves: ‘We know the true dhamma’, how is that the true dhamma? They exchanged our things for a hall for robes, and distributed them, as if we don’t know that robes are hard to get, and they should have five robes complete? According to what the Buddha has said, one generates the highest merit by building a good building and offering it to the sangha of the four directions.” When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They criticized these bhikkhunīs: “Why did you exchange things that householders have given for building a precept-recitation hall for robes, and distribute them?” The bhikkhunīs told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized these bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why, bhikkhunīs, did you exchange things from householders for building a precept-recitation hall for robes, and distribute them?” Then, when the World-honored One had criticized these bhikkhunīs in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī knows that a supporter has given something to the sangha for a certain purpose, and she diverts it towards another use, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>所為僧施異者，與作說戒堂用作衣、與作衣用作說戒堂、與此處乃彼處用。</lzh>
“Giving something to the sangha for a certain purpose” means using what was given for building a precept-recitation hall to make robes, or using what was given for making robes to build a precept-recitation hall, or using what was given for this purpose for another purpose.

<lzh>僧物、為僧、屬僧。僧物者，已許僧。為僧者，為僧作而未許僧。屬僧者，已許與僧、已捨與僧。</lzh>
“The sangha’s things; what is for the sangha; and what belongs to the sangha”: “The sangha’s things” means what has already been promised to the sangha. “For the sangha” means what has already been made for the sangha, but hasn’t been promised to the sangha yet. “Belonging to the sangha” means what has already been promised and given to the sangha, what has already been handed over to the sangha.

<lzh>若比丘尼，知檀越所為僧施異，迴作餘用者，尼薩耆波逸提。此尼薩耆應捨與僧、若眾多人、若一人，不得別眾捨，若捨不成捨，突吉羅。捨與僧時，應往僧中偏露右肩、脫革屣、禮僧足已，右膝著地，合掌作是語：「大姊僧聽！我某甲比丘尼所為僧施異，而迴作餘用，犯捨墮，今捨與僧。」捨已當懺悔。前受懺人，當作白已然後受懺，如是白：「大姊僧聽！此某甲比丘尼所為僧施異，而迴作餘用，犯捨墮，今捨與僧。若僧時到僧忍聽，我受某甲比丘尼懺。白如是。」作此白已然後受懺。當語彼人言：</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī knows that a supporter has given something to the sangha for a certain purpose, and she diverts it towards another use, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. This nissaggiya should be relinquished to the sangha, or to a group of people, or to a single person. One may not relinquish it to a divided assembly. If she relinquishes it (to them), the relinquishing isn’t accomplished, and it’s a dukkaṭa. When she relinquishes it to the sangha, she should go into the midst of the sangha, uncover her right shoulder, take off her leather sandals, and having paid respect at the sangha’s feet, place her right knee on the ground, join her palms, and say: 


<h2>Saṅghakamma</h2>

<lzh>“</lzh>
Venerable sisters, may the sangha listen. I, bhikkhunī So-and-so, have diverted for another use what was given to the sangha for a certain purpose. I’ve committed a nissaggiya pācittiya. Now I relinquish it to the sangha.” 


<h2>Explanation (continued)</h2>


When she has relinquished it, she should confess. First the person who receives the confession should carry out the motion, and then receive the confession. She makes the motion as follows: 


<h2>Saṅghakamma</h2>

<lzh>“</lzh>
Venerable sisters, may the sangha listen. This bhikkhunī So-and-so has diverted for another use what was given to the sangha for a certain purpose. She has committed a nissaggiya pācittiya. Now she has relinquished it to the sangha. If the right time has come for the sangha, may the sangha approve that I receive bhikkhunī So-and-so’s confession. This is the motion.” 


<h2>Explanation (continued)</h2>


When she has carried out this motion, she should receive her confession and tell her: 

<lzh>「自責汝心。」答言：「爾。」僧即應還此比丘尼衣，作白二羯磨，應如是與。僧中應差堪能作羯磨者如上，當作如是白：「大姊僧聽！此某甲比丘尼所為僧施異，迴作餘用，犯捨墮，今捨與僧。若僧時到僧忍聽，還某甲比丘尼衣。白如是。」「大姊僧聽！此某甲比丘尼所為僧施異，迴作餘用，犯捨墮，今捨與僧。誰諸大姊忍僧還此某甲比丘尼衣者默然，誰不忍者說。」「僧已忍還某甲比丘尼衣竟，僧忍，默然故，是事如是持。」</lzh>
“Correct your mind!” She answers: “Yes.” The sangha should then return that bhikkhunī’s robes, and a formal act with a motion as second should be carried out as follows: In the sangha, they should choose a capable person who can carry out formal acts as above. She should carry out the motion as follows: 


<h2>Saṅghakamma</h2>

<lzh>“</lzh>
Venerable sisters, may the sangha listen. This bhikkhunī So-and-so has diverted for another use what was given to the sangha for a certain purpose. She has committed a nissaggiya pācittiya. Now she has relinquished it to the sangha. If the right time has come for the sangha, may the sangha approve to return bhikkhunī So-and-so’s robes. This is the motion.” “Venerable sisters, may the sangha listen. This bhikkhunī So-and-so has diverted for another use what was given to the sangha for a certain purpose. She has committed a nissaggiya pācittiya. Now she has relinquished it to the sangha. Those of the venerable sisters who accept that the sangha returns bhikkhunī So-and-so’s robes should remain silent. Those who don’t accept this should speak.” “The sangha has accepted to return bhikkhunī So-and-so’s robes. The sangha accepts this, therefore you’re silent. This matter is remembered thus.”


<h2>Explanation (continued)</h2>

<lzh>於僧中捨衣竟不還者，突吉羅。還時若有人教言：「莫還。」者，突吉羅。若受作五衣、若轉作淨施、若作餘用、若遣與人、若故壞、若燒、若作非衣、若數數著，一切突吉羅。</lzh>
If, after she has relinquished the robes in the midst of the sangha, they don’t return them, it’s a dukkaṭa. If when they return them, someone instructs them: “Don’t return them”, it’s a dukkaṭa (for that person). If they accept them and make the five robes out of them, if they turn them into a pure offering<note> vikappana</note>, if they use them for another purpose, if they send them to someone, if they intentionally damage them, if they burn them, if they turn them into something other than a robe, or if they frequently wear them, in all cases it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，若問主用隨所分處用；若與物時語言：「隨意用。」不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she asks the owner and uses it, if she uses it for what it was intended; and if, when they give the item, they say: “Use it as you like,” the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。(二十竟)</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 20th rule.)
