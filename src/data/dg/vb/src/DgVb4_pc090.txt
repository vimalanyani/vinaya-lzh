<h2>First Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在婆祇陀國。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāketa.

<lzh>時六群比丘尼二人同一床臥，諸比丘尼見謂與男子共臥，見起時乃知非男子。</lzh>
Then the group-of-six bhikkhunīs lay down two together on the same bed. The householders saw it and said that they were lying down together with a man. When they saw them get up, then they knew that it wasn’t a man.

<lzh>時有一大將，勇健多智、眾術備具善能鬪戰，始娶婦未久被官勅當征，便生此念：「我今遠征，婦當付誰？」正欲付囑居士，居士家多諸男子，不得付囑。大將先與跋提迦毘羅比丘尼知識，念言：「我今寧可將婦付囑迦毘羅比丘尼已，然後出征。」即便付之。時迦毘羅比丘尼受其婦，為擁護故共同床止宿。此迦毘羅比丘尼身體細軟，此婦人身觸生染著心。時大將征還迎婦歸家，其婦樂著比丘尼身細軟，便逃走還至彼尼所。此大將作是念：「我欲作好而更得惡，云何我婦今不愛樂我，染著比丘尼，逃走還趣彼所？」 </lzh>
Then there was a general, brave, strong and knowledgeable, with many skills and much equipment, able to fight battles. He had recently gotten married when he was ordered by the ruler to carry out a campaign. He thought: “I’ll now go far away. To whom should I entrust my wife?” At first he wanted to entrust her to a householder, but in the householder’s home, there were many men, and he wasn’t able to leave her there. Previously, the general had been aquainted with Bhaddā Kāpilānī bhikkhunī and he thought: “I’d better now entrust my wife to Kāpilānī bhikkhunī, and then depart to the front.” Then he left her there. When Kāpilānī bhikkhunī had receive his wife, they stayed overnight in the same bed for protection. Kāpilānī bhikkhunī’s body was slender and soft, and when the wife came in contact with it, defiled attachment arose in her mind. When the general returned from the front, went to meet his wife, and took her home, she delighted in and was attached to the bhikkhunī’s slender and soft body. She ran away and returned to the bhikkhunī’s place. The general thought: “I wanted to do the right thing and have obtained what is bad. Why doesn’t my wife love me now, has defiled attachment to the bhikkhunī, ran away, and returned to her place?” 

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責六群比丘尼及跋提迦毘羅比丘尼：「云何汝等，二人同床共臥？」時諸比丘尼往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊爾時以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責六群比丘尼及迦毘羅比丘尼：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何汝等二人，共同床臥？」時世尊以無數方便呵責六群及迦毘羅比丘尼已，告諸比丘：「此六群及迦毘羅比丘尼，多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼二人共同床臥者，波逸提。」如是世尊與比丘尼結戒。</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked the group-of-six bhikkhunīs and Bhaddā Kāpilānī bhikkhunī: “Why did you lie down two together on the same bed?” Then the bhikkhunīs went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs and Kāpilānī bhikkhunī: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you lie down two together on the same bed?” Then, when the World-honored One had criticized the group-of-six and Kāpilānī bhikkhunīs in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These group-of-six and Kāpilānī bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Preliminary Ruling</h2>

‘If bhikkhunīs lie down two together on the same bed, it’s a pācittiya.’” In this way the World-honored One laid down the precept for the bhikkhunīs.


<h2>Second Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>時有疑者，不敢與病比丘尼共床臥，亦不敢更互坐、更互臥。佛言：「聽與病者同床臥。聽更坐更臥。自今已去應如是結戒：若比丘尼無病，二人共床臥，波逸提。」</lzh>
Then some had doubts. They didn’t dare to lie down on a bed together with a sick bhikkhunī, and they also didn’t dare to take turns sitting down, and to take turns lying down. The Buddha said: “I allow to lie down on the same bed with someone who is sick. I allow to take turns sitting or lying down. From now on, you should recite the precept like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If bhikkhunīs who aren’t sick lie down two together on a bed, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>床者，有五種如上。</lzh>
“A bed” means there are five kinds as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼無病，二人共同床臥，隨脇著床敷，一一波逸提。隨轉，一一波逸提。</lzh>
If bhikkhunīs who aren’t sick lie down two together on the same bed, whenever they place their flanks on the bed laid out, each time is a pācittiya. When they turn over, each time is a pācittiya.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，若與病人共床臥，若更互坐更互臥，或病倒地、為強力者所執、或被縛、或命難、梵行難，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she lies down on a bed together with a sick person, if they take turns sitting or lying down, if she’s sick and falls to the ground, if she’s held by force, if she’s arrested, if her life is in danger, or if her celibacy is in danger, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 90th rule.)
