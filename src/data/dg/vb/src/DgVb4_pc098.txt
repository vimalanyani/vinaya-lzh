<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時波斯匿王界內人民反叛。爾時六群比丘尼，在彼界內有疑恐怖處遊行。時諸賊見已皆作是言：「此六群比丘尼，皆為波斯匿王所供養，我等當共觸嬈。」時諸居士見皆共譏嫌言：「此比丘尼，無有慚愧皆犯梵行，外自稱言：『我修正法。』如是有何正法？乃於界內，有疑恐怖處遊行，如賊女婬女無異。」</lzh>
Then the people within King Pasenadi’s territory rebelled. At that time, the group-of-six bhikkhunīs wandered in a dubious, frightening place within that country. When the bandits saw them, they all said: “These group-of-six bhikkhunīs are all supported by King Pasenadi. We’ll molest them.” When the householders saw this, they were all upset and said: “These bhikkhunīs have no shame and they all break their celibacy. Outwardly, they praise themselves: ‘We know the true dhamma’, how is that the true dhamma? Then they wander within the country in a dubious, frightening place. There’s no difference to criminals and prostitutes.”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責六群比丘尼：「汝等云何於人間恐怖處遊行？」即往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊爾時以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責六群比丘尼：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何汝等在界內人間恐怖處遊行？」時世尊以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此六群比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼於界內有疑恐怖處在人間遊行，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “Why did you wander among the people in a frightening place?” Then they went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you wander among the people in a frightening place within the country?” When the World-honored One had criticized them in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These group-of-six bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī wanders among the people in a dubious, frightening place within the country, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>界內者，繞城四面。</lzh>
“Within the country” means the regions around fortified cities.

<lzh>有疑者，疑有賊盜也。</lzh>
“Dubious” means dubious because there are bandits.

<lzh>恐怖者，恐有賊盜。</lzh>
“Frightening” means frightening because there are bandits.

<lzh>若比丘尼，於彼界內有疑恐怖處人間遊行，隨入村內行一一界，一一波逸提。無村阿蘭若處，行至十里，一波逸提。減一村、減十里，突吉羅。村中行一界內，一突吉羅。若方便欲去而不去、共期去而不去，一切突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī wanders among the people in a dubious, frightening place within the country, whenever she enters a village and walks from one territory to the next, each is a pācittiya. If there’s no village and she walks 10 leagues in the wilderness, it’s a pācittiya. If she walks less than the distance of a village, or less than 10 leagues, it’s a dukkaṭa. If within one village, she walks in one territory, it’s a dukkaṭa. If she plans and wants to go but doesn’t go, or if she makes an appointment to go but doesn’t go, in all cases it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，若有所白、若被喚、若請去、若為強力者所執、若被繫縛、或命難、梵行難，若先至後有疑恐怖事起者，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if there’s a message to convey, if she’s summoned, if she’s invited to go, if she’s held by force, if she’s arrested, if her life is in danger, if her celibacy is in danger, or if she goes there first and later a dubious, frightening situaton arises, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 98th rule.)
