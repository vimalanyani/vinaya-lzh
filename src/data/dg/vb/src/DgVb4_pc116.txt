<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時有眾多比丘尼，向拘薩羅國在道行，至一無住處村，語其舍主，於舍內敷敷具而宿。至明日清旦，不辭主人而去，後村舍失火燒舍。時被燒居士謂舍內有人，便不往救火，火燒舍盡，即問：「比丘尼在何處？」答言：「已去。」諸居士皆共譏嫌言：「此比丘尼等不知慚愧，外自稱言：『我修正法。』如是有何正法？云何語主人在舍內止宿，明日不辭主人而去？我等謂舍內有人，而不救火，使燒舍盡。」</lzh>
Then there was a group of bhikkhunīs who were walking on a road towards the country of Kosala and had reached a village without a resthouse. They spoke with the owner of a house, laid out bedding inside the house and stayed there overnight. When dawn came the next day, they left without taking leave of the owner. Later, a fire broke out in the village and the house was burning. When it was burning, the householder thought that there were people inside the house, and they didn’t go to put out the fire. The fire completely burnt down the house. Then they asked: “Where are the bhikkhunīs?” Someone answered: “They’ve already left.” Then the householders were all upset and said: “These bhikkhunīs know no shame. Outwardly, they praise themselves: ‘We know the true dhamma’, how is that the true dhamma? Why did they tell the owner that they’ll stay overnight inside the house, and leave the next day without taking leave of them? We thought that there were people inside the house, and didn’t put out the fire, which made the house burn down completely.”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責諸比丘尼言：「汝云何語主人在他舍內宿，去時不語其主，令火燒他舍盡？」即往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白佛。佛以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責諸比丘尼言：「汝云何語主人在他舍內宿，去時不語，使火燒他舍盡？」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼至白衣舍，語主人敷座止宿，明日不辭主人而去，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked these bhikkhunīs: “Why did you speak with the owner, stay overnight in their house, and then when you left, you didn’t inform them, which made their house burn down completely?” Then they went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the Buddha. The Buddha for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha and criticized these bhikkhunīs: “Why did you speak with the owner, stay overnight in their house, and then when you left, you didn’t tell them, which made their house burn down completely?” When he had criticized them in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī comes to a lay house, speaks with the owner, lays out seats to stay overnight, and leaves the next day without taking leave of the owner, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>白衣舍者，村。</lzh>
“A lay house” means a village.

<lzh>宿者，在中止宿處是。</lzh>
“Staying overnight” means there’s a place to stay overnight.

<lzh>敷敷者，或草敷或葉敷，下至自敷臥氈。</lzh>
“Laying out bedding” means laying out grass, or leaves, … or a sleeping mat.

<lzh>彼比丘尼，至白衣舍內，語主人敷座止宿。明日不辭而去出門，波逸提。一脚在內、一脚在外，方便欲去而不去，若共期去而不去，一切突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī enters a lay house, speaks with the owner, lays out seats to stay overnight, and leaves the next day without taking leave, when she goes through the gate, it’s a pācittiya. If she has one foot inside and one foot outside, if she plans and wishes to go but doesn’t go, or if she makes an appointment to go but doesn’t go, all cases are dukkaṭas.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，辭主人而去，若先有人在舍內住、若舍先空、若先為福舍、若是親厚，親厚者語言：「汝但去，當為汝語主人。」若舍崩壞、若為火燒、若中有毒蛇惡獸、若有賊入、或為強力者所執、若被繫閉、或命難、梵行難，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she takes leave of the owner and goes, if there are people already living in the house, if the house was previously empty, if it previously was a house for making merit, if they’re friends, if a friend says: “Just leave, I’ll tell the owner for you,” if the house collapses, if it’s on fire, if there’s a poisonous snake, or a savage animal inside, if criminals enter, if she’s held by force, if she’s imprisoned, if her life is in danger, or if her celibacy is in danger, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 116th rule.)
