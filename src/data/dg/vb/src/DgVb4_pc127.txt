<h2>First Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼，度他婬女與授具足戒，先與此女人親厚者，見已自相謂言：「此婬女先與我等作如是如是事。」時所度比丘尼及餘比丘尼聞之皆慚恥。</lzh>
Then the bhikkhunīs gave the full ordination to prostitutes. When their former clients saw them, they said to each other: “These prostitutes previously did such-and-such a thing with us.” When those newly-ordained bhikkhunīs and the other bhikkhunīs heard this, they were all ashamed.

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責諸比丘尼言：「云何汝等乃度他婬女，與授具足戒耶？」即白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責諸比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。汝等云何度他婬女與授具足戒耶？」時世尊以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼與如是人授具足戒者，波逸提。」如是世尊與比丘尼結戒。</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked these bhikkhunīs: “Why did you give the full ordination to prostitutes?” Then they told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha and criticized these bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you give the full ordination to prostitutes?” When the World-honored One had criticized them in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Preliminary Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī gives the full ordination to such a person, it’s a pācittiya.’” In this way the World-honored One laid down the precept for the bhikkhunīs.


<h2>Second Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>諸比丘尼，不知如是人、非如是人，後乃知是，或有作波逸提懺者、或疑者。「不知者無犯。自今已去當如是結戒：若比丘尼，知如是人與授具足戒者，波逸提。」</lzh>
The bhikkhunīs didn’t know if she was such a a person or not. They only found out later. Some confessed a pācittiya, some had doubts. (The Buddha said:) “If you don’t know, there’s no offense. From now on, you should recite the precept like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī knows that she’s such a person and gives her the full ordination, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above. 

<lzh>如是人者，婬女也，彼或有夫主、或有夫主兄弟，乃至有故私通者。</lzh>
“Such a person” means a prostitute. She has a husband, or there are her husband’s brothers, or even the men from her former affairs.

<lzh>若比丘尼，與如是人授具足戒者，應將至五六由旬。若不去，當深藏安處之。彼比丘尼，度如是人授具足戒已，不將去五六由旬、若不深藏者，波逸提。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī gives such a person the full ordination, she should take her five or six yojanas away. If they don’t go, she should hide her well in a safe place. If a bhikkhunī gives the full ordination to such a person and doesn’t take her five or six yojanas away, or hides her, it’s a pācittiya.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，先不知如是人便與授具足戒，若將至五六由旬、若教人將至五六由旬，若深藏，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she doesn’t know at first that she’s such a person and gives her the full ordination, if she takes her five or six yojanas away, if she instructs others to take her five or six yojanas away, or if she hides her, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 127th rule.)
