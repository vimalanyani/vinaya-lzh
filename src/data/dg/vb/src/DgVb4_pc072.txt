<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在釋翅搜迦維羅衛尼俱律園中。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was among the Sakyans in Kapilavatthu, in the Banyan tree park.

<lzh>時摩訶波闍波提比丘尼往至世尊所，頭面禮足在一面立，白佛言：「世尊！女人身臭穢不淨。」說是語已，即禮佛足繞三匝而去。時世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，告諸比丘：「自今已去聽諸比丘尼以水作淨。」時偷羅難陀聞此制已，即以水作淨，欲心內指水道中，指深爪傷內，血出污身衣臥具。諸比丘尼即問言：「何所患苦？」即具說因緣。</lzh>
Then Mahāpajāpatī bhikkhunī went to the World-honored One, paid respect with her head at his feet, stood at one side, and said to the Buddha: “World-honored One, a woman’s body stinks, is dirty, and is impure.” When she had said this, she paid respect at the Buddha’s feet, circumambulated him three times, and left. Then the World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and said to the bhikkhus: “From now on, I allow the bhikkhunīs to clean themselves with water.” Then when Thullanandā heard that this had been laid down, she cleaned herself with water and with a lustful mind inserted her finger into the vagina. The finger went deep inside and her fingernail injured her internally. Blood ran out and soiled her body, her robes, and the bedding. The bhikkhunīs then asked her: “What do you suffer from?” Then she fully explained the reason.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責偷羅難陀比丘尼：「云何水作淨，乃以指內水道中傷內，血出污身衣及污臥具？」諸比丘尼往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊爾時以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責偷羅難陀比丘尼：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何汝以水作淨，以欲心內指爪深傷內，血出污身衣及臥具？」時世尊以無數方便呵責偷羅難陀已，告諸比丘：「此偷羅難陀多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼以水作淨，應齊兩指各一節，若過者，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked Thullanandā bhikkhunī: “Why did you, when cleaning yourself with water, insert your finger into the vagina and injure yourself internally, so that blood ran out and soiled your body, your robes, and the bedding?” Then the bhikkhunīs went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized Thullanandā bhikkhunī: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you, when cleaning yourself with water, with a lustful mind insert your finger and injure yourself deep inside, so that blood ran out and soiled your body, your robes, and the bedding?” Then, when the World-honored One had criticized Thullanandā in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “This Thullanandā has all kinds of taints, and is the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī cleans herself with water, she should insert up to two fingers, each one finger joint deep. If she exceeds that, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>水作淨者，以水洗內。</lzh>
“Cleaning with water” means washing inside with water.

<lzh>彼比丘尼，以水作淨，內兩指各一節，過者，波逸提。</lzh>
A bhikkhunī who cleans herself with water should insert (up to) two fingers, each one joint deep. If she exceeds that, it’s a pācittiya.

<lzh>式叉摩那、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a sikkhamānā and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，若齊兩指各一節、若減一節、或有如是病、或內有草、或內有蟲挽出，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she inserts up to two fingers, each one joint deep or less than one joint deep, if she has a certain illness, or if there are grass or insects inside that she pulls out, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 72nd rule.)
