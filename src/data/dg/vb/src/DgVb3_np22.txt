<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時安隱比丘尼有居士為檀越，到時著衣持鉢至其家敷座而坐。時居士問訊：「住止安樂不？」答言：「不安樂。」問言：「何故爾？」答言：「所止處憒鬧，是故不安樂。」即問：「無別房耶？」答言：「無。」「若與舍直，能作舍不？」答言：「能。」彼即以舍直與之。時彼比丘尼作是念：「我設作舍者多諸事務，比丘尼衣服難得，應辦五衣。我今寧可以此舍直貿衣耶？」即便貿衣。後於異時，安隱比丘尼著衣持鉢，至居士家就座而坐。</lzh>
Then, Khemā bhikkhunī had a householder as a supporter. When the right time had come, she put on her robes, took her bowl, went to their house, laid out a seat, and sat down. Then the householder inquired: “Do you dwell comfortably?” She answered: “I’m not comfortable.” They asked: “Why so?” She answered: “The place where I stay is disorderly and noisy, therefore I’m not comfortable.” Then they asked: “Isn’t there a separate building?” She answered: “No.” “If I give funds for an abode, can you build one?” She answered: “I can.” They then gave funds for an abode. The bhikkhunī then thought: “If I arrange to build an abode, there will be many duties. For bhikkhunīs, robes are hard to get, and I should prepare my five robes. I’d better now exchange these funds for an abode for robes.” Then she exchanged them for robes. At a later time, Khemā bhikkhunī put on her robes, took her bowl, went to the householder’s house, and then sat down on a seat.

<lzh>居士問言：「阿姨！住止安樂不？」答言：「不安樂。」問言：「何以不安樂？」答言：「所止處憒鬧故不安樂。」即問言：「無別房耶？」答言：「無。」復問：「前所與舍直竟不作舍耶？」答言：「不作。」復問：「何以故不作？」答言：「我自作是念：『若以此物作舍者多諸事務，比丘尼衣服難得應辦五衣。』即以此物貿衣。」時居士譏嫌言：「此比丘尼受無厭足，外自稱言：『我知正法。』如是何有正法？我與舍直作舍，而乃用貿衣。我豈不知比丘尼衣服難得應具五衣耶？但我等聞世尊所說，最第一福者作房施四方僧也。」</lzh>
The householder asked: “Venerable, do you dwell comfortably?” She answered: “I’m not comfortable.” They asked: “Why are you not comfortable?” She answered: “The place where I stay is disorderly and noisy, therefore I’m not comfortable.” Then they asked: “Isn’t there a separate building?” She answered: “No.” They asked again: “Haven’t you built an abode with the funds for an above I’ve given previously?” She answered: “I haven’t built it.” They asked again: “Why haven’t you built it?” She answered: “I thought to myself: ‘If I build an abode with these things, there will be many duties. For bhikkhunīs, robes are hard to get, and I should prepare my five robes.’ Then I exchanged these things for robes.” Then the householder was upset and said: “This bhikkhunī accepts without moderation. Outwardly, she praises herself: ‘I know the true dhamma’, how is that the true dhamma? I gave funds for an abode to build an abode, but she used them to exchange them for robes, as if I don’t know that for bhikkhunīs robes are hard to get, and they should have five robes complete? But I heard the World-honored One say that the highest merit is to build a building and offer it to the sangha of the four directions.”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，呵責安隱言：「汝云何檀越與物作房舍乃用作衣？」諸比丘尼白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊爾時以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責安隱比丘尼：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何檀越與物作屋乃用作衣？」時世尊以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「安隱比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，檀越所施物異迴作餘用者，尼薩耆波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They criticized Khemā: “Why did you, when a supporter has given things for building a residence, use them to make robes?” Then the bhikkhunīs told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized Khemā bhikkhunī: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you, when a supporter has given things for building a residence, use them to make robes?” Then, when the World-honored One had criticized her in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “Khemā bhikkhunī has all kinds of taints, and is the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī, when a supporter has given an item for a certain purpose, diverts it towards another use, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>所為施物異者，作別房用作衣，施作衣用作別房，若為餘處施乃餘處用。</lzh>
“Having given an item for a certain purpose” means using what was for building a separate building to make robes, or using what was given to make robes for building a separate building, or using what was given for one purpose for another purpose.

<lzh>若比丘尼，所為施物異，作別房迴作餘用者，尼薩耆波逸提。此尼薩耆，應捨與僧如上法。捨竟懺悔如上。僧即應還彼捨衣，白二羯磨還如上。若不還，受作五衣乃至作非衣用，若數數著，一切突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī, when an item has been given for a certain purpose, to build a separate building, diverts it towards another use, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. This nissaggiya should be relinquished to the sangha, as in the rule above. When she has relinquished it, she should confess as above. The sangha should then return the relinquished robe to her in a formal act with a motion as second to return them as above. If they don’t return them, if they accept them and make the five robes out of them, … if they turn them into something other than a robe and use them, or if they frequently wear them, in all cases it’s a dukkaṭa as above.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，問檀越用隨檀越處分用，若與時語言：「隨意用。」若親厚人語言：「隨意用。」我當語主，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she asks the supporter and uses it, if she uses it according to the supporter’s intention, if when they give it, they say: Use it as you like,” or if their friend says: “Use it as you like, I’ll tell the owner,” the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 22nd rule.)
