<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時六群比丘尼，多畜好色器，不好者留置，彼畜如是多器，不洗治料理狼藉在地。時有眾多居士詣諸寺觀看，見已譏嫌言：「此六群比丘尼，受取無厭、不知慚愧，外自稱言：『我知正法。』如是何有正法？多畜器狼藉在地，如瓦肆無異。」</lzh>
Then the group-of-six bhikkhunīs kept many beautiful utensils, and put the less beautiful ones aside. They kept many utensils like this, but didn’t wash them or arrange them properly, and put them on the ground in disorder. Then a group of householders came to the monastery and looked around. When they saw it, they were upset and said: “These group-of-six bhikkhunīs take without limit and know no shame. Outwardly, they praise themselves: ‘We know the true dhamma’, how is that the true dhamma? They keep many utensils in disorder on the ground. There’s no difference to a potter’s shop.”

<lzh>諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，呵責六群比丘尼：「云何汝等多畜器狼藉在地？」時諸比丘尼往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊爾時以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責六群比丘尼：「汝等所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何六群比丘尼！多畜器狼藉在地？」時世尊以無數方便呵責六群比丘尼已，告諸比丘：「此六群比丘尼，多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼多畜好色器者，尼薩耆波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “Why did you keep many utensils in disorder on the ground?” Then the bhikkhunīs went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why, group-of-six bhikkhunīs, did you keep many utensils in disorder on the ground?” Then, when the World-honored One had criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These group-of-six bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī keeps many beautiful utensils, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼，即日得器應即日受，可須用者十六枚，餘者當淨施、若遣與人。十六者，大釜、釜蓋、大瓫及杓、小釜、釜蓋、小瓫及杓、水瓶、瓶蓋、瓫及杓、洗瓶、瓶蓋、瓫及杓。若比丘尼畜多器者，尼薩耆波逸提。此尼薩耆，應捨捨與僧如上。捨竟懺悔如上法。僧即應還彼捨器，白二羯磨還如上。若僧不還，乃至數數用，一切突吉羅如上。</lzh>
On the day that a bhikkhunī obtains a utensil, that very day she should accept it. She may properly use sixteen utensils, and turn the rest into pure offerings<note>vikappana</note> or send them to others. “Sixteen” means a large pot, a pot lid, a large storage container, and a ladle; a small pot, a pot lid, a small storage container, and a ladle; a water jug, a jug lid, a storage container<note> 瓫 is likely a translation of Sanskrit kuṇḍa, which is probably related to Pāli kuṇḍolika, a storage container. The variant reading 貯水大瓫, “large container for storing water” supports this.</note>, and a ladle; a washing-water jug, a jug lid, a storage container, and a dipper.
If a bhikkhunī keeps many utensils, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. This nissaggiya should be relinquished to the sangha, as above. When she has relinquished it, she should confess as in the rule above. The sangha should then return the relinquished utensil to her in a formal act with a motion as second to return it as above. If the sangha doesn’t return it, … or if they frequently use it, in all cases it’s a dukkaṭa as above. 

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，即日得器當受十六枚，餘者當淨施、若遣與人；若作奪想、若失想、若破想、若漂想、不作淨、不遣與人，不犯；若奪器、若失器、若破器、若漂器、若取自用、若他與器用；若彼所寄器比丘尼命終、若休道、若遠行、若賊將去、若惡獸難、若水漂、不作淨、不遣與人，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if on the day she obtains utensils, she accepts sixteen, and turns the others into pure offerings, or sends them to others; if she perceives the utensils as having been stolen, lost, broken, or washed away, and therefore she doesn’t turn them into pure offerings or send them to others, the offense isn’t committed. If her utensils are stolen, lost, broken, or washed away, and she herself takes and uses (the new ones), or if others give the utensils to her to use; if the bhikkhunī she has entrusted with the utensils dies, disrobes, goes on a long journey, is abducted by criminals, is in danger from savage animals, or is washed away by water, and she doesn’t turn it into a pure offering or send it to others, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 25th rule.)
