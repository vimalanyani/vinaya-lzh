<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時佛在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Buddha was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時世尊制戒，聽度人授具足戒，而諸比丘尼癡者，度人不知教授。以不教授故不按威儀、著衣不齊整、乞食不如法、處處受不淨食、或受不淨鉢食、在小食大食上高聲大喚，如婆羅門聚會法。</lzh>
Then the World-honored One had laid down a precept and allowed to give the full ordination to others. So bhikkhunīs who were foolish ordained people and didn’t know how to instruct them. Because they weren’t instructed, they weren’t established in proper conduct, didn’t wear their robes neatly, did their almsround not according to dhamma, accepted improper food here and there, or accepted food in improper bowls, and shouted loudly during breakfast and lunch like at a gathering of brahmins.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，呵責諸比丘尼言：「汝等云何世尊制戒聽度人，而汝等愚癡，輒便度人而不知教授，以不教授故不按威儀，乃至在小食大食上高聲大喚，如婆羅門聚會法？」即白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責諸比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何世尊制戒雖聽度人，汝等愚癡，輒便度人而不知教授，以不教授故不按威儀，乞食不如法、處處受不淨食、或受不淨鉢食、在小食大食上高聲大喚，如婆羅門聚會法耶？」世尊以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They criticized these bhikkhunīs: “When the World-honored One had laid down a precept and allowed to ordain people, why did you, who are ignorant, just ordain people without knowing how to instruct them? Because they weren’t instructed, they weren’t established in proper conduct, … and shouted loudly during breakfast and lunch like at a gathering of brahmins.” Then they told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha and criticized these bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. When the World-honored One had laid down a precept, and even though he had allowed to ordain people, why did you, who are ignorant, just ordain people without knowing how to instruct them? Because they weren’t instructed, they weren’t established in proper conduct, did their almsround not according to dhamma, accepted improper food here and there, or accepted food in improper bowls, and shouted loudly during breakfast and lunch like at a gathering of brahmins.” When the World-honored One had criticized them in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: 

<lzh>「自今已去聽僧與授具足戒者，白二羯磨。彼欲度人者，當往眾僧中求，當作如是求。至比丘尼眾中，偏露右肩脫革屣、禮諸比丘尼足、右膝著地合掌，作如是白：『大姊僧聽！我某甲比丘尼，求眾僧乞度人授具足戒。』如是第二、第三說。比丘尼僧當觀察此人，堪能教授與二歲學戒、二事攝取不？一者法，二者衣食。如是，聽。若不堪教授，不能與二歲學戒及二法攝取法及衣食者，當語言：『妹止！勿度人。』</lzh>
“From now on, I allow that the sangha does a formal act with a motion as second for the person who gives the full ordination. Someone who wants to ordain people should go the sangha and request it. She should carry out the request as follows: She should go into the midst of the sangha, uncover her right shoulder, take off her leather sandals, pay respect at the sangha’s feet, place her right knee on the ground, join her palms, and carry out this motion: 


<h2>Saṅghakamma</h2>

‘Venerable sisters, may the sangha listen. I, bhikkhunī So-and-so, ask the sangha for the (formal act of) Giving-of-full-ordination.’ A second and third time should be recited likewise. 


<h2>Origin Story (continued)</h2>


The bhikkhunī sangha should examine this person, as to whether she’s capable of instructing someone, of giving the training precepts for two years, and of assisting someone with the two things: one is the dhamma, the other are robes and food. If she can, they should allow it. If she’s not able to instruct, can’t give the training precepts for two years, and can’t assist someone with the two things: the dhamma, and robes and food, they should say: ‘Younger sister, enough! Don’t ordain people.’

<lzh>若有智慧、堪能教授，與二歲學戒，以二法攝取者，眾中當差堪能羯磨者如上，作如是白：『大姊僧聽！此某甲比丘尼，今從眾僧乞授人具足戒。若僧時到僧忍聽，與某甲授人具足戒。白如是。』『大姊僧聽！此某甲比丘尼，今從眾僧乞授人具足戒。僧今與某甲比丘尼授人具足戒。誰諸大姊忍僧與某甲授人具足戒者默然，誰不忍者說。』『眾僧已忍聽與某甲比丘尼授人具足戒竟，僧忍，默然故，是事如是持。』</lzh>
If she’s wise, capable of instructing, of giving the training precepts for two years, and of assisting someone in regard to the two things, then in the sangha, they should choose a capable person who can carry out formal acts as above. She should carry out the motion as follows: 


<h2>Saṅghakamma</h2>

‘Venerable sisters, may the sangha listen. This bhikkhunī So-and-so now asks the sangha for the Giving-of-full-ordination. If the right time has come for the sangha, may the sangha approve to give So-and-so the Giving-of-full-ordination. This is the motion.’ ‘Venerable sisters, may the sangha listen. This bhikkhunī So-and-so now asks the sangha for the Giving-of-full-ordination. The sangha now gives bhikkhunī So-and-so the Giving-of-full-ordination. Those of the venerable sisters who accept that the sangha gives So-and-so the Giving-of-full-ordination should remain silent. Those who don’t accept this should speak.’ ‘The sangha has approved to give bhikkhunī So-and-so the Giving-of-full-ordination. The sangha accepts this, therefore it’s silent. This matter is remembered thus.’


<h2>Origin Story (continued)</h2>

<lzh>自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，僧不聽而授人具足戒者，波逸提。」</lzh>
From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī gives the full ordination to someone without the sangha’s approval, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>僧者如上。</lzh>
“Sangha” is as above.

<lzh>聽者，眾僧白二羯磨聽。</lzh>
“Approval” means the sangha allows it in a formal act with a motion as second.

<lzh>彼比丘尼，若僧不聽，授人具足戒者，波逸提。眾僧不聽，便與依止，若畜沙彌尼、式叉摩那者，突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī gives the full ordination to someone without the sangha’s approval, it’s a pācittiya. If she gives dependence, or takes on a sāmaṇerī or a sikkhamānā without the sangha’s approval, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，眾僧聽授人具足戒，受比丘尼依止及畜沙彌尼、式叉摩那，是謂不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if, with the sangha’s approval, she gives the full ordination to someone, or accepts a bhikkhunī in dependence, or takes on a sāmaṇerī or sikkhamānā, this is called “not committed”.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 130th rule.)
