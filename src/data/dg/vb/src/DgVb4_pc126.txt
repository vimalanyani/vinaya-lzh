<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>諸比丘尼聞世尊制戒得度十歲曾嫁女人，與二歲學戒，滿十二與授具足戒，便度他盲瞎、跛躄、聾及餘種種病者，毀辱眾僧。</lzh>
The bhikkhunīs heard that the World-honored One had laid down a precept and allowed to ordain a 10 year old married woman and to give her the training precepts for two years, and when she’s 12 years old, to give her the full ordination. They ordained people who were blind, lame, crippled, deaf, and who had all kinds of other diseases that disgraced the sangha.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，呵責諸比丘尼言：「世尊制戒度年十歲曾嫁婦女，與二歲學戒，滿十二與授具足戒。汝云何乃度他盲瞎、聾及餘種種病，毀辱眾僧？」時諸比丘尼往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責諸比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何世尊制戒聽比丘尼度年十歲曾嫁婦女，與二歲學戒，滿十二與授具足戒。而汝等乃度他盲瞎、跛躄、聾及餘種種病，毀辱眾僧？」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They criticized these bhikkhunīs: “The World-honored One has laid down a precept to ordain a 10 year old married woman, and to give her the training precepts for two years, and when she’s 12, to give her the full ordination. Why did you then ordain people who are blind, deaf, and who have all kinds of other diseases that disgrace the sangha?” Then the bhikkhunīs went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha and criticized these bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you, when the World-honored One had laid down a precept and allowed the bhikkhunīs to ordain a 10 year old married woman, and to give her the training precepts for two years, and when she’s 12, to give her the full ordination, then ordain people who are blind, lame, crippled, deaf, and who have all kinds of other diseases that disgrace the sangha?” When he had criticized them in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus:

<lzh>「自今已去聽與授具足戒白四羯磨。當作如是與。將受戒者至離聞處著見處，乃至我已教授竟聽使來亦如上。來已至尼僧中，戒師應作白，問難事乃至白四羯磨如上，乃至大僧中與授戒，一一法如上十八童女法同。</lzh>
“From now on, I allow to give the full ordination in a formal act with a motion as fourth. You should do the following to give (the ordination): Take the ordination candidate to a place out of earshot but within sight, … ‘I, having instructed her, allow her to come’, also as above. When she has come to the bhikkhunī sangha, the precepts master should carry out a motion and ask about the difficulties … a formal act with a motion as fourth as above … give the precepts in the bhikkhu sangha rule by rule as above, in the same way as in the rule about the 18 year old girl.

<lzh>自今已去當與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，度他小年曾嫁婦女，與二歲學戒，年滿十二，不白眾僧便與授具足戒，波逸提。」</lzh>
From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī ordains a young married woman and gives her the training precepts for two years, and when she’s 12 years old, just gives her the full ordination without informing the sangha, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼，度小年曾嫁婦女，與二歲學戒，年滿十二，不白眾僧便與授具足戒，三羯磨竟，尼和上，波逸提。白二羯磨，三突吉羅。白一羯磨，二突吉羅。白已一，突吉羅。白未竟，突吉羅。未白前集眾眾滿，一切突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī ordains a young married woman and gives her the training precepts for two years, and when she’s 12 years old, just gives her the full ordination without informing the sangha, when they’ve carried out the three announcements, the preceptor commits a pācittiya. When they’ve carried out the motion and two announcements, it’s three dukkaṭas. When they’ve carried out the motion and one announcement, it’s two dukkaṭas. When they’ve carried out the motion, it’s one dukkaṭa. If the motion hasn’t yet been finished, it’s a dukkaṭa. If they haven’t yet done the motion, when they gather the sangha, or when the assembly is complete, in all cases it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，度年滿十二曾嫁婦女，白眾僧受具足戒，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she ordains a 12 year old, married woman and informs the sangha when she gives the full ordination, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 126th rule.)
