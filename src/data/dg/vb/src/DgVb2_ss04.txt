<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時世尊在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。有比丘尼在阿蘭若處住，有一居士於此處作一精舍，施與比丘尼僧住。後異時阿蘭若處比丘尼有惡事出，諸比丘尼捨此精舍去。居士後命終，時居士兒即耕此精舍地。諸比丘尼見語言：「此是眾僧地。莫耕！」居士兒答言：「實爾。我父在時作此精舍與比丘尼僧。比丘尼僧捨去，我父命終，我今自由，何為空此處地？彼此無用耶！」時居士兒如故耕之，諸比丘尼即往斷事官所言。爾時諸斷事官即喚居士兒依法決斷，罰其財貨盡入於官。</lzh>
At that time, the World-honored One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park. Then the bhikkhunīs lived in the wilderness, and there was a householder who was building a monastery in that place to offer to the bhikkhunī sangha to stay in. At a later time, bad things happened to the bhikkhunīs who lived in the wilderness, and they abandoned this monastery and left. Later, the householder passed away. His child then tilled the soil in the monastery. The bhikkhunīs saw it and said: “This is the land of the sangha. Don’t till it!” The householder’s child answered: “That’s true. When my father was alive, he built this monastery, and gave it to the bhikkhunī sangha. The bhikkhunī sangha has abandoned it and left, my father has passed away, and I’m now independent. Why should this land be empty? That’s of no use!” When the householder’s child tilled as before, the bhikkhunīs went and informed the judges. Then the judges summoned the the householder’s child to deliberate the case according to the law. All their wealth was confiscated as a punishment.

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責彼比丘尼：「云何比丘尼詣官言居士兒，使財物入官也？」爾時諸比丘尼白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊爾時以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責彼比丘尼：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何比丘尼詣官言人？」爾時世尊以無數方便呵責彼比丘尼已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼言人，若居士、居士兒、若奴、若客作人，若晝、若夜、若一念頃、若彈指頃、若須臾頃，是比丘尼犯初法應捨，僧伽婆尸沙。」如是世尊與比丘尼結戒。 </lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked those bhikkhunīs: “Why does a bhikkhunī go to the judges to speak about householder’s children, and have their wealth confiscated?” The bhikkhunīs told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized those bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why does a bhikkhunī go to the judges to speak about people?” Then, when the World-honored One had criticized those bhikkhunīs in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “Those bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: ‘If a bhikkhunī speaks about people, whether a householder, a householder’s child, a slave, or a worker, whether by day or by night, or just for one instant, for the snap of a finger, for one moment, that bhikkhunī commits an immediate offense that should be given up, a saṅghādisesa.’” In this way the World-honored One laid down the precept for the bhikkhunīs.

<lzh>爾時拘薩羅國波斯匿王小婦，作一精舍施與比丘尼，彼比丘尼受住已，後捨人間遊行。時王小婦，聞比丘尼捨精舍人間遊行，輒復以此精舍轉與女梵志。時彼比丘尼聞，念言：「我行不在，輒以我精舍與人。」時彼比丘尼即還精舍，語女梵志言：「避我去！莫住我精舍。」彼女梵志答言：「此實是汝精舍，施主為汝作；汝出人間遊行，持用與我，我今不能出去。」時彼比丘尼㥲，即牽曳令出。時女梵志即詣斷事官言。時諸斷事官喚比丘尼，比丘尼疑難不去，自念：「世尊制戒，不得詣斷事官相言。」</lzh>
At that time, a concubine of King Pasenadi of Kosala built a monastery to offer to the bhikkhunīs. When the bhikkhunīs had accepted it and had stayed there, they abandoned it to wander among the people. When the king’s concubine heard that the bhikkhunīs had abandoned the monastery to wander among the people, she turned over the monastery to female renunciates. When those bhikkhunīs heard that, they thought: “We went wandering and weren’t there, and our monastery was turned over to others.” Then they returned to the monastery, and said to the female renunciates: “Leave us and go away. Don’t stay in our monastery.” Those female renunciates answered: “This was truly your monastery, a donor had built it for you. You left and went wandering among the people, and it was offered to us. Now we can’t leave.” Then those bhikkhunīs got angry and dragged them out. The female renunciates then went and spoke with the judges. When the judges summoned the bhikkhunīs, they were in doubt and didn’t go, thinking: “The World-honored One has laid down a precept that we may not go to the judges to speak about others.”

<lzh>爾時比丘尼白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊告諸比丘：「自今已去若有喚應往。」時彼比丘尼，即往斷事官所，諸斷事官問言：「阿姨！此事云何？好說。」比丘尼答言：「此一切地皆屬王，家事屬居士，房舍屬施主，床座臥具亦爾。修治房舍令眾僧住止，得福多。何以故？由其施我得安住故。」諸斷事官答言：「如阿姨所說，一切地屬王，家事屬居士，屋舍屬施主，床座臥具亦爾。修治房舍令僧住止，得福多。何以故？由其施我得安住故。今此精舍應與女梵志令住。」爾時諸比丘往白世尊。世尊告諸比丘：「此比丘尼不善說，斷事官亦不善答。何以故？前施是法，後施非法。」爾時波斯匿王聞比丘尼如是說、諸斷事官如是答、世尊作如是語時，王罰諸斷事官財物盡入官。諸比丘聞，往白世尊。世尊爾時告諸比丘：「自今已去當如是說戒：若比丘尼詣官言，居士若居士兒、若奴、若客作人，若晝、若夜、若一念頃、若彈指頃、若須臾頃，是比丘尼犯初法應捨，僧伽婆尸沙。」</lzh>
Then the bhikkhunīs told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One said to the bhikkhus: “From now on, if they’re summoned, they should go.” Then those bhikkhunīs went to the judges, and the judges asked them: “Venerables, what is this matter? Explain it well.” The bhikkhunīs answered: “This whole land belongs to the king, the household items belong to the householders, the monastery belongs to the donor, and the beds, seats, and bedding likewise. Maintaining a building for the sangha to stay in brings much merit. Why? Because through their gift, we live in peace.” The judges answered: “As the venerables say: ‘This whole land belongs to the king, the household property belongs to the householders, the monastery belongs to the donor, and the beds, seats, and bedding likewise. Maintaining a building for the sangha to stay in brings much merit. Why? Because through their gift, we live in peace.’ Now this monastery should be given to the female renunciates to stay.” Then the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One said to the bhikkhus: “Those bhikkhunīs haven’t spoken well, and the judges also haven’t answered well. Why? The first offering was according to the law, the later offering was against the law.” Then when king Pasenadi heard that the bhikkhunīs had said this, and the judges had answered thus, and the World-honored One had spoken in this way, the king punished the judges, and confiscated all their wealth. The bhikkhus heard this, and they went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then said to the bhikkhus: “From now on, you should recite the precept like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī goes to a judge to speak about a householder, a householder’s child, a slave, or a worker, whether by day, or by night, or just for one instant, for the snap of a finger, for one moment, that bhikkhunī commits an immediate offense that should be given up, a saṅghādisesa.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>相言者，詣官共諍曲直。</lzh>
“Speaking about others” means going to a judge and quarreling with each other about right and wrong.

<lzh>居士者，不出家人。</lzh>
“A householder” means not a renunciate.

<lzh>兒者，居士所生。</lzh>
“A child” means someone born to a householder.

<lzh>奴者，或買得、或家所生。</lzh>
“A slave” means either someone bought, or someone born in that household.

<lzh>客作者，財雇使作也。</lzh>
“A worker” means hired with money to work.

<lzh>女梵志者，在此法外出家者是。</lzh>
“A female renunciate” (brahmacārinī) means someone gone forth in a non-Buddhist sect.

<lzh>若比丘尼言人，若居士、居士兒，若奴、客作人，若晝、若夜、若一念頃、若彈指頃、若須臾頃，如女梵志詣官稱其事。若斷事官下手疏事者，僧伽婆尸沙。口說不著名字者，偷羅遮。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī speaks about people, whether a householder, a householder’s child, a slave, or a worker, whether by day or by night, or just for one instant, for the snap of a finger, for one moment, like the female renunciates who went to the judges and argued their case, and if the judges take on the case, it’s a saṅghādisesa. If she speaks without revealing someone’s name, it’s a thullaccaya.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, this is a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，若被喚，若欲有所啟，若為強力所持去，若被繫將去，若命難、若梵行難，雖口說不告官，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s summoned, if she wants to report something, if she’s taken there by force, if she’s arrested and brought there, if her life is in danger, if her celibacy is in danger, and if although she speaks, she doesn’t file a lawsuit, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。(四竟)</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the fourth rule.)
