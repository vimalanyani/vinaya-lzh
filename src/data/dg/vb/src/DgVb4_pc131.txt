<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時世尊在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the World-honored One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼，聞世尊制戒聽比丘尼，從眾僧乞授人具足戒。彼新學少年從眾僧乞授人具足戒已，不能教授。以不被教授故不按威儀，著衣不齊整、乞食不如法、處處受不淨食、或受不淨鉢食、在小食大食上高聲大喚，如婆羅門聚會法。</lzh>
Then the bhikkhunīs heard that the World-honored One had laid down a precept and allowed the bhikkhunīs to ask the sangha for the Giving-of-full-ordination. When newly-trained, young ones had asked the sangha for the Giving-of-full-ordination, they couldn’t instruct. Because (the new bhikkhunīs) weren’t instructed, they weren’t established in proper conduct, didn’t wear their robes neatly, did their almsround not according to dhamma, accepted improper food here and there, or accepted food in improper bowls, and shouted loudly during breakfast and lunch like at a gathering of brahmins.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者嫌責諸比丘尼：「汝等聞世尊制戒聽度人，云何新學少年乞授人具足戒已不能教授，彼以不被教授故不按威儀，著衣不齊整，乃至小食大食上高聲大喚，如婆羅門聚會法？」時諸比丘尼嫌責已，往語諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責此諸比丘尼：</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked these bhikkhunīs: “When you heard that the World-honored One had laid down a precept and allowed to ordain people, why did you, who are newly-trained and young, ask for the Giving-of-full-ordination without being able to instruct? Because (the new bhikkhunīs) weren’t instructed, they weren’t established in proper conduct, didn’t wear their robes neatly, … and shouted loudly during breakfast and lunch like at a gathering of brahmins.” When the bhikkhunīs had rebuked them, they went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha and criticized these bhikkhunīs: 

<lzh>「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何汝等新學少年乞授人具足戒，而不能教授。彼以不被教授故，不按威儀，著衣不齊整、乞食不如法，乃至高聲大喚，如婆羅門聚會法？」時世尊以無數方便呵責此諸比丘尼已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼年未滿十二歲，授人具足戒者，波逸提。」</lzh>
“What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you, who are newly-trained and young, ask for the Giving-of-full-ordination without being able to instruct? Because (the new bhikkhunīs) weren’t instructed, they weren’t established in proper conduct, didn’t wear their robes neatly, did their almsround not according to dhamma, … and shouted loudly like at a gathering of brahmins.” When the World-honored One had criticized these bhikkhunīs in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī, who doesn’t yet have 12 vassa, gives the full ordination to someone, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>若比丘尼年減十二，授人具足戒者，波逸提。若減十二，與人依止、畜式叉摩那、沙彌尼，一切突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī, who doesn’t yet have 12 vassa, gives the full ordination to someone, it’s a pācittiya. If she has less than 12 and gives dependence, or takes on a sikkhamānā or a sāmaṇerī, in all cases it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，年滿十二授人具足戒，若與依止，畜式叉摩那、沙彌尼，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she has 12 vassa and gives the full ordination to someone, or gives dependence, or takes on a sikkhamānā or a sāmaṇerī, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 131st rule.)
