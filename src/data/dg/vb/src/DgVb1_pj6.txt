<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時世尊在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。爾時舍衛城中有長者，名沙樓鹿樂，顏貌端正，偷羅難陀比丘尼亦顏貌端正。鹿樂長者繫心偷羅難陀所，偷羅難陀亦繫心鹿樂所。爾時偷羅難陀比丘尼欲心，受長者捉手、捉衣，共入屏處、共立、共語、共行，以身相倚共期。爾時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責偷羅難陀比丘尼：「汝云何欲心，受長者捉手、捉衣，入屏處共立、共語、共行、以身相倚共期？」</lzh>
At that time, the World-honored One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park. Then there was a householder in Sāvatthī called Sāḷha Migāranatta, who was good-looking. Thullanandā bhikkhunī also was good-looking. The householder Migāranatta’s mind was attached to Thullanandā, and Thullanandā’s mind was also attached to Migāranatta. Then, Thullanandā bhikkhunī, with a lustful mind, let the householder hold her hand, hold her robe, they entered a secluded place together, stood together, talked together, walked together, leaned their bodies against each other, and made appointments. When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked Thullanandā bhikkhunī: “Why did you with a lustful mind let the householder hold your hand, and hold your robe, why did you enter a secluded place, stand together, talk together, walk together, lean your bodies against each other, and make appointments?” 

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊爾時以此因緣集諸比丘僧，呵責偷羅難陀：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何偷羅難陀比丘尼！欲心受此長者捉手、捉衣，乃至共期？」爾時世尊以無數方便呵責偷羅難陀已，告諸比丘：「此偷羅難陀多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼染污心，知男子染污心，受捉手、捉衣，入屏處共立、共語、共行、或身相倚、或共期，是比丘尼波羅夷，不共住，犯此八事故。」</lzh>
Then the bhikkhunīs told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized Thullanandā: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why, Thullanandā bhikkhunī, did you with a lustful mind let this householder hold your hand, and hold your robe, … make appointments?” Then, when the World-honored One had criticized Thullanandā in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “This Thullanandā has all kinds of taints, and is the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī with a defiled mind knows that a man has a defiled mind, and lets him hold her hand, and hold her robes, and they enter a secluded place, stand together, talk together, walk together, lean their bodies against each other, and make appointments, that bhikkhunī is pārājika, and doesn’t live in community, because she committed the eight things.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>染污心者，心有染著，染污心男子亦有染著。</lzh>
“A defiled mind” means that her mind has defiled attachment. “A man with a defiled mind” also has defiled attachment.

<lzh>捉手者，捉手乃至腕。</lzh>
“Holding her hand” means holding her hand, up to the wrist.

<lzh>捉衣者，捉身上衣。</lzh>
“Holding her robe” means holding the robe on the body.

<lzh>入屏處者，離見聞處也。</lzh>
“Entering a secluded place” means a place out of sight or earshot.

<lzh>屏處共立者，離見聞處也。</lzh>
“Standing together in a secluded place” means in a place out of sight or earshot.

<lzh>共語者，亦離見聞處。</lzh>
“Talking together” also means in a place out of sight or earshot.

<lzh>共行者，亦離見聞處。</lzh>
“Walking together” also means in a place out of sight or earshot.

<lzh>身相倚者，身得相及處。</lzh>
“Leaning their bodies against each other” means a place where the bodies can touch each other.

<lzh>共期者，得共行婬處也。</lzh>
“Making appointments” means at a place where they can engage in sexual intercourse together.

<lzh>彼比丘尼染污心，受染污心男子捉手，偷羅遮。捉衣，偷羅遮。入屏處，屏處共立、屏處共語、屏處共行，以為樂，以身相倚，一一偷羅遮。</lzh>
If that bhikkhunī with a defiled mind lets a man with a defiled mind hold her hand, it’s a thullaccaya. If he holds her robe, it’s a thullaccaya. If they enter a secluded place, stand together in a secluded place, talk together in a secluded place, walk together in a secluded place, and for pleasure lean their bodies against each other, each is a thullaccaya.

<lzh>於七事中，若不發露懺悔，罪未除。若犯第八事，波羅夷。天子、龍子、阿修羅子、夜叉子、餓鬼、畜生能變形者，犯七事，一一突吉羅。若犯第八事，偷羅遮。畜生不能變形者，犯第八事，突吉羅。與染污心女人犯第八事者，突吉羅。</lzh>
If she doesn’t reveal and confess these seven things, and hasn’t removed the offenses, if she commits the eighth thing, it’s a pārājika. If, with a god, a dragon, an asura, a yakkha, a hungry ghost, or an animal that can change shape, she commits the seven things, each is a dukkaṭa. If she commits the eighth thing, it’s a thullaccaya. If she commits the eight things with an animal that can’t change shape, it’s a dukkaṭa. If she commits the eight things with a woman with a defiled mind, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘隨所犯；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, this is treated according to whatever he committed. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，若有所取與時手相觸、或戲笑、或有所救解捉衣；若有所施與、若禮拜、若悔過、若受法，入屏處共住；若有所施與、若禮拜、若悔過、若受法，入屏處共立；若有所施與、若禮拜、若悔過，若受法，入屏處共語；若有所施與、若禮拜、若懺悔、若受法，入屏處共行；若為人打、若賊來、若有象來、若惡獸來、若有刺來迴身避，若來求教授、若聽法、若受請、若來至寺內，若共期不可作惡事處，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if their hands come in contact when she takes or gives something, or when she jokes around, or if she holds someone’s clothes when she saves them; if they enter and stay together in a secluded place when she offers something, when she pays respect, when she confesses offenses, or when she receives dhamma teachings; if they enter and stand together in a secluded place when she offers something, when she pays respect, when she confesses offenses, or when she receives dhamma teachings; if they enter and talk together in a secluded place when she offers something, when she pays respect, when she confesses offenses, or when she receives dhamma teachings; if they enter and walk together in a secluded place when she offers something, when she pays respect, when she confesses offenses, or when she receives dhamma teachings; if people beat her, if criminals come, if an elephant comes, if a savage animal comes, if there are brambles, and she turns her body to avoid them, if she comes to ask for instruction<note> Ovāda.</note>, or to hear the dhamma, if she’s invited, if she comes to the monastery, or if they make an appointment in a place where one can’t do unwholesome things, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒、癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。(六竟)</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the sixth rule.)
