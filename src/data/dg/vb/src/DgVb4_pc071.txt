<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國。時偷羅難陀比丘尼剃三處毛，往詣檀越家在婦女前就座而坐，不自覆身露其形體。時彼婦女見已語言：「阿姨！共洗浴來。」答言：「且止！」便為得供養已，復語言：「但來共浴。」答言：「我不須洗浴。」時諸婦女即強脫衣見其剃處，即語言：「阿姨！世人所以剃毛者為欲事，阿姨以何故剃之？」偷羅難陀答言：「我從俗已來習此法，不但今也。」時諸居士婦女即譏嫌言：「比丘尼不知慚愧，習不淨行，外自稱言：『我知正法。』如是有何正法？乃剃三處毛，猶如婬女、賊女。」</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī. Then Thullanandā bhikkhunī shaved the hair in the three places and went to a supporter’s house. She sat down on a seat in front of the women, didn’t cover herself, and exposed her body. When the women saw it, they said: “Venerable, come and bathe with us.” She answered: “Enough.” In order to make merit, they said again: “Just come and bathe with us.” She answered: “I don’t need to bathe.” Then the women forcefully took off her clothes, saw that she had shaved these places, and then said: “Venerable, worldly people shave the hair because of lustful matters, for what reason does the venerable shave?” Thullanandā answered: “I’ve this habit since I was a lay person, not just now.” The ladies of the house then were upset and said: “This bhikkhunī knows no shame and practices impure conduct. Outwardly, she praises herself: ‘I know the true dhamma’, how is that the true dhamma? Then she shaves the hair in the three places, like a prostitute or a criminal.”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責偷羅難陀言：「汝云何乃剃三處毛？」諸比丘尼往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責偷羅難陀：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何偷羅難陀乃剃三處毛？」時世尊以無數方便呵責偷羅難陀已，告諸比丘：「此偷羅難陀比丘尼！多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼剃三處毛者，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked Thullanandā: “Why did you shave the hair in the three places?” Then the bhikkhunīs went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized Thullanandā: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why, Thullanandā, did you shave the hair in the three places?” Then, when the World-honored One had criticized Thullanandā in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “This Thullanandā bhikkhunī has all kinds of taints, and is the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī shaves the hair in the three places, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>三處毛者，大小便處及腋下。</lzh>
“The hair in the three places” means around the anus and the vagina, and under the arms.

<lzh>若比丘尼剃三處毛，一動刀一波逸提。若拔、若揃滅、若燒，一切突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī shaves the hair in the three places, each stroke of the blade is a pācittiya. If she pulls it out, if she cuts it, or if she burns it, in all cases it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，偷羅遮；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a thullaccaya. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，或有如是病，若有瘡須剃去著藥，或為強力者所執，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she has a certain illness, if she has an abscess and needs to shave to apply medicine, or if she’s held by force, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 71st rule.)
