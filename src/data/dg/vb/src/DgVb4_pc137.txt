<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時有式叉摩那，持衣往僧伽藍中，至諸比丘尼所語言：「與我受具足戒，我當持此衣與。」時偷蘭難陀比丘尼語言：「妹與我衣，我當授汝具足戒。」即持衣與之。偷蘭難陀受他衣已，亦不方便與授具足戒。時式叉摩那嫌責言：「云何語我言：『大妹！與我衣來，我當授汝具足戒。』而受我衣已，不與我授具足戒耶？」</lzh>
Then there was a sikkhamānā, who took a robe and went to the monastery. She went to the bhikkhunīs and said: “Give me the full ordination and I’ll give you this robe.” Thullanandā bhikkhunī said: “Younger sister, give me the robe and I’ll give you the full ordination.” Then (the sikkhamānā) took the robe and gave it to her. When Thullanandā had received the robe, she still didn’t make plans to give her the full ordination. Then the sikkhamānā was upset and said: “Why did you tell me: ‘Venerable younger sister, give me the robe and I’ll give you the full ordination’, but when you had received my robe, you didn’t give me the full ordination?”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責偷羅難陀言：「云何要語式叉摩那言：『妹！與我衣來，當與汝授具足戒。』而受他衣已，竟不與授具足戒耶？」呵責已白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責偷蘭難陀言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何語式叉摩那言：『妹！與我衣來，當與汝授具足戒。』而受衣已，竟不與他授具足戒耶？」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼語式叉摩那言：『持衣來！我當與汝授具足戒。』而不方便與授具足戒，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked Thullanandā: “Why did you promise a sikkhamānā: ‘Younger sister, bring me a robe and I’ll give you the full ordination’, but when you had received her robe, you didn’t give her the full ordination?” Having criticized her, they told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha and criticized Thullanandā: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you say to a sikkhamānā: ‘Younger sister, bring me a robe and I’ll give you the full ordination’, but when you had received the robe, you didn’t give her the full ordination?” When he had criticized her in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “This bhikkhunī has all kinds of taints, and is the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī says to a sikkhamānā: “Bring me a robe and I’ll give you the full ordination,” but doesn’t make plans to give her the full ordination, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>衣者，有十種如上。</lzh>
“A robe” means there are 10 kinds, as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼語式叉摩那言：「妹！持衣來，我當與汝授具足戒。」受衣已，不作方便與授具足戒者，波逸提。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī says to a sikkhamānā: ‘Younger sister, bring me a robe and I’ll give you the full ordination’, but when she has received the robe, doesn’t make plans to give her the full ordination, it’s a pācittiya.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，許與授具足戒便與授具足戒，若病、若無共活者、若無五衣、若無十眾，若彼缺戒、若破戒、破見、破威儀、若被舉、若滅擯、若應滅擯，若命難、梵行難，而不方便與授具足戒，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she promises to give the full ordination and then gives the full ordination, if she’s sick, if they then don’t live together, if there are no five robes, if there’s no assembly of 10, if (the sikkhamānā) is deficient in the precepts, breaks the precepts, breaks right view, breaks proper conduct, if she has been suspended, has been permanently expelled, or should be permanently expelled, if (the bhikkhunī’s) life is in danger because of this, or if her celibacy is in danger, and she doesn’t make plans to give her the full ordination, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 137th rule.)
