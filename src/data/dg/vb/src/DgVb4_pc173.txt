<h2>First Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時六群比丘尼，先住後至、後至先住，欲惱亂彼故，在前經行、若立、若坐、若臥。</lzh>
Then the group-of-six bhikkhunīs did walking meditation, stood, sat, or lay down in front of others who had lived there before when they had arrived later, or who had arrived later when they had lived there before, because they wanted to irritate and distract them.

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼聞，中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，呵責六群比丘尼言：「汝云何在先住後至比丘尼前，欲惱亂故，若經行、若立、若坐、若臥耶？」即白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責六群比丘尼言：「汝所為非、非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何汝等，先住後至比丘尼前，欲惱亂故，若經行、若立、若坐、若臥耶？」以無數方便呵責已、告諸比丘：「此六群比丘尼！多種有漏處、最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，先住後至、後至先住，欲惱亂彼故，在前經行、若立、若坐、若臥，波逸提。」如是世尊與比丘尼結戒。</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “Why did you do walking meditation, stand, sit, or lie down in front of a bhikkhunī who had lived there before when you had arrived later, because you wanted to irritate and distract her?” Then they told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha and criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you do walking meditation, stand, sit, or lie down in front of a bhikkhunī who had lived there before when you had arrived later, because you wanted to irritate and distract her?” When he had criticized them in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These group-of-six bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Preliminary Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī does walking meditation, stands, sits, or lies down in front of someone who has lived there before when she has arrived later, or has arrived later when she has lived there before, because she wants to irritate and distract her, it’s a pācittiya.’” In this way the World-honored One laid down the precept for the bhikkhunīs.


<h2>Second Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>彼比丘尼，不知先住、不先住，後至、不後至，後乃知，或作波逸提懺者、有疑者。「不知者無犯。若比丘尼，知先住後至、後至先住，欲惱彼故，在前經行、若立、若坐、若臥，波逸提。」</lzh>
Then the bhikkhunīs didn’t know who had lived there before and who hadn’t lived there before, or who had arrived later and who hadn’t arrived later. They only found out later. Some confessed a pācittiya, some had doubts. (The Buddha said:) “If you don’t know, there’s no offense. (From now on, you should recite the precept like this:) 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī knows that someone has lived there before when she has arrived later, or has arrived later when she has lived there before, and she does walking meditation, stands, sits, or lies down in front of her because she wants to irritate her, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼，知先住後至、後至先住，欲惱彼故，在前經行、若立、若坐、若臥者，波逸提。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī knows that someone has lived there before when she has arrived later, or has arrived later when she has lived there before, and she does walking meditation, stands, sits, or lies down in front of her because she wants to irritate her, it’s a pācittiya.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，若先不知若問，若先聽經行，若是上座，若更互經行，若次經行，若是親厚，若親厚者語言：「汝但經行，我當為汝語。」若病倒地，若強力者所執，或被繫縛，若命難、若梵行難，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she doesn’t know at first, if she asks, if the other has previously allowed her to do walking meditation, if she’s senior, if they alternate doing walking meditation, if they do walking meditation according to seniority, if they’re friends, if her friend says: “Just do walking meditation, I’ll tell her for you,” if she’s sick and falls to the ground, if she’s held by force, if she’s arrested, if her life is in danger, or if her celibacy is in danger, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 173rd rule.)
