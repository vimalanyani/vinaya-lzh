<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼，聞世尊制戒聽授人具足戒，彼便在尼眾中與授具足戒，經宿已方往比丘僧中。而所與授具足戒者，中間或得盲瞎、癡聾、跛躄及餘種種諸病，毀辱眾僧。</lzh>
Then the bhikkhunīs heard that the World-honored One had laid down a precept and allowed to give the full ordination to others, and they then gave the the full ordination in the bhikkhunī sangha, and after a night had passed, they went to the bhikkhu sangha. And some among the people who had been given the full ordination became blind, deluded, deaf, lame, crippled, and got all kinds of other diseases that disgraced the sangha.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，呵責諸比丘尼言：「世尊制戒聽度人，汝等云何乃度盲瞎、癡聾、跛躄及餘種種病，毀辱眾僧耶？」呵責已白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責諸比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何乃度諸盲瞎、癡聾、跛躄及餘種種病，毀辱眾僧耶？」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，與人授具足戒已，經宿方往比丘僧中與授具足戒者，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They criticized these bhikkhunīs: “When the World-honored One had laid down a precept and allowed to ordain people, why did you then ordain people who are blind, deluded, deaf, lame, crippled, and have all kinds of other diseases that disgrace the sangha?” Having criticized them, they told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha and criticized these bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you ordain people who are blind, deluded, deaf, lame, crippled, and have all kinds of other diseases that disgrace the sangha?” When he had criticized them in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī when she has given the full ordination to someone, goes to the bhikkhu sangha to give the full ordination after a night has passed, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>比丘尼，應即日授具足戒，即日詣比丘僧中授具足戒。彼比丘尼，與授具足戒，經宿已方詣比丘僧中授具足戒，波逸提。是謂為犯。</lzh>
On the same day that a bhikkhunī gives the full ordination, she should also go to the bhikkhu sangha to give the full ordination. If a bhikkhunī gives the full ordination, and goes to the bhikkhu sangha to give the full ordination after a night has passed, it’s a pācittiya. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，即日與授具足戒；即日往比丘僧中授具足戒；若欲往授具足戒，彼病、若水陸道斷、若有惡獸難、若賊難、若水大涱、若為強力者所執，若被繫閉，若命難、梵行難，不得即日往詣比丘眾中，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she gives the full ordination and goes to the bhikkhu sangha to give the full ordination on the same day, if she wants to go there to give the full ordination, but is sick, or if a waterway or overland road has been cut off, if there’s a danger from savage animals, if there’s a danger from criminals, if there’s a great flood, if she’s held by force, if she’s imprisoned, if her life is in danger, or if her celibacy is in danger, and she can’t go to the bhikkhu sangha on the same day, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 139th rule.)
