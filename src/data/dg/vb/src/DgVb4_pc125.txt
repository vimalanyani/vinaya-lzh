<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時世尊制戒聽比丘尼授人具足戒，而度他少年婦女與授具足戒。授具足戒已，不知男子有染污心、無染污心，與染污心男子共立、共語、共相調戲。</lzh>
Then the World-honored One had laid down a precept and allowed the bhikkhunīs to give the full ordination to others. And they gave the full ordination to young married women. When they had given the full ordination, (the women) didn’t know if men had defiled minds or not. They stood, talked, and amused themselves together with men with defiled minds.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責諸比丘尼：「汝云何世尊制戒聽比丘尼度人授具足戒，乃度他少年曾嫁婦女授具足戒，受具足戒已不知男子有染污心、無染污心，與染污心男子共立、共語、共相調戲？」往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責諸比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何度他少年曾嫁婦女與授具足戒，受具足戒已，不知男子有染污心、無染污心，與有染污心男子共立、共語、共相調戲？」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked these bhikkhunīs: “Why did you, when the World-honored One had laid down a precept and allowed the bhikkhunīs to give the full ordination to someone, give the full ordination to young married women? When they had received the full ordination, they didn’t know if men had defiled minds or not, and they stood, talked, and amused themselves together with men with defiled minds.” They went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha and criticized these bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you give the full ordination to young married women? When they had received the full ordination, they didn’t know if men had defiled minds or not, and they stood, talked, and amused themselves together with men with defiled minds.” When he had criticized them in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: 

<lzh>「自今已去若欲度人授具足戒者，先白眾僧剃髮乃至與十戒如上法。自今已去聽度十歲曾嫁女人與二歲學戒，年滿十二與授具足戒。白四羯磨如上。</lzh>
From now on, if you want to give the full ordination to someone, you should first inform the sangha of the head-shaving … giving the 10 precepts as in the rule above. From now on, I allow to ordain a 10 year old married woman, to give her the training precepts for two years, and to give her the full ordination when she’s 12 in a formal act with a motion as fourth as above.

<lzh>自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，度曾嫁婦女年十歲，與二歲學戒，年滿十二，聽與授具足戒。若減十二與授具足戒者，波逸提。」</lzh>
From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī ordains a married, 10 year old woman, and gives her the training precepts for two years, then it’s allowed to give her the full ordination when she’s 12 years old. If she’s less than 12 and one gives her the full ordination, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼，知減十二與授具足戒，三羯磨竟，和上尼，波逸提。白二羯磨竟，三突吉羅。白一羯磨竟，二突吉羅。白已，一突吉羅。白未竟，突吉羅。未白前集眾眾滿，一切突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī knows that she’s less than 12 and gives her the full ordination, when they’ve carried out the three announcements, the preceptor commits a pācittiya. When they’ve carried out the motion and two announcements, it’s three dukkaṭas. When they’ve carried out the motion and one announcement, it’s two dukkaṭas. When they’ve carried out the motion, it’s one dukkaṭa. If the motion hasn’t yet been finished, it’s a dukkaṭa. If they haven’t yet done the motion, when they gather the sangha, or when the assembly is complete, in all cases it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，年十歲度與二歲學戒，滿十二與授具足戒，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she ordains and gives the training precepts for two years to a 10 year old, and when she’s 12, gives her the full ordination, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 125th rule.)
