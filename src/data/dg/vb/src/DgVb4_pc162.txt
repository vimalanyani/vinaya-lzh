<h2>First Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時六群比丘尼眾中有一比丘尼，向暮輒開僧伽藍門出，無所語而去。時諸賊見已生念：「我當劫其財物。」念已即便入門，劫奪財物盡。時諸比丘尼自相問言：「是誰向暮開門無所語而去？」即聞六群比丘尼中一人開門而出。</lzh>
Then there was a bhikkhunī among the group-of-six bhikkhunīs who just opened the monastery gate around dusk and left without telling anyone. When criminals saw this, they thought: “We’ll plunder their valuables.” Having thought this, they immediately entered through the gate and stole all the valuables. Then the bhikkhunīs asked each other: “Who opened the gate around dusk and left without telling anyone?” Then they heard that one of the group-of-six bhikkhunīs had opened the gate and left.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，呵責六群比丘尼言：「汝云何向暮無所語開門而出？」即白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責六群比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何比丘尼，向暮無所語開門而出？」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，向暮開僧伽藍門出者，波逸提。」如是世尊與比丘尼結戒。</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunī: “Why did you open the gate around dusk without telling anyone and leave?” Then they told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunī: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why, bhikkhunī, did you open the gate around dusk without telling anyone and leave?” When he had criticized her in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “This bhikkhunī has all kinds of taints, and is the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Preliminary Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī opens the monastery gate around dusk and leaves, it’s a pācittiya.’” In this way the World-honored One laid down the precept for the bhikkhunīs.


<h2>Second Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>時諸比丘尼，以佛法僧事，或有看視病事，皆疑不敢出。佛言：「自今已去聽囑授出。自今已去當如是說戒：若比丘尼，向暮開僧伽藍門，不囑授餘比丘尼而出者，波逸提。」</lzh>
Then the bhikkhunīs had matters of the Buddha, the dhamma, and the sangha, or they looked after the sick. They all had doubts and didn’t dare to leave. The Buddha said: “From now on, I allow to inform someone and leave. From now on, you should recite the precept like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī opens the monastery gate around dusk and leaves without informing other bhikkhunīs, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼，向暮開僧伽藍門不囑而出門者，波逸提。一脚在內、一脚在外，若方便欲去而不去，若共期去而不去，一切突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī opens the monastery gate around dusk and leaves without informing anyone, it’s a pācittiya. If she has one foot inside and one foot outside, if she plans and wishes to go but doesn’t go, or if she makes an appointment to go but doesn’t go, all cases are dukkaṭas.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，或佛法僧事，或看病事囑而出，若僧伽藍破壞，若為火所燒，若有毒蛇、若有賊、若有惡獸，若為強力者所執，若被繫縛將去，或命難、梵行難，不囑而出者，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if there are matters of the Buddha, the dhamma, and the sangha, or if she looks after the sick, and she informs someone and leaves, if the monastery is destroyed, if it’s on fire, if there’s a poisonous snake, a criminal, or a savage animal, if she’s held by force, if she’s arrested and made to go, if her life is in danger, or if her celibacy is in danger, and she leaves without informing anyone, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 162nd rule.)
