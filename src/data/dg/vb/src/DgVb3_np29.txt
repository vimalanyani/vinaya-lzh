<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在毘舍離獼猴江側高閣講堂上。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Vesālī, in the hall with the peaked roof near the monkey pond. 

<lzh>時毘舍離梨奢有因緣應從一居士得財物。時有比丘尼名迦羅，常出入此居士家，以為檀越。時梨奢語迦羅言：「我欲及阿姨一財物事。」報言：「可爾。」即為辦其事。彼得財物歡喜，問言：「阿姨！欲須何物？」報言：「止！此便為供養我已。」彼復問言：「阿姨！若有所須便說。」報言：「且止！何須說？正使我有所須，俱不見與。」居士報言：「但說，所須我當相與。」彼即指示一衣價直千張疊言：「我須如是衣。」時居士皆共譏嫌言：「比丘尼受取無厭，外自稱言：『我知正法。』如是何有正法？云何乃索價直千張疊衣，正使檀越施與，猶應知足。」彼即持與，復作是語：「若我往者，足自辦此事，可不失此衣。」</lzh>
Then a Licchavi from Vesālī for some reason was to obtain some goods from a householder. At that time, there was a bhikkhunī named Kālī who often went in and out of that householder’s house. They were her supporters. Then the Licchavi said to Kālī: “I’d like the venerable to take care of the matter with those goods.” She replied: “Okay.” Then she took care of this matter. They obtained the goods and asked her happily: “Venerable, what do you want or need?” She replied: “Enough. This is for having offered things to me.” They asked again: “Venerable, if there’s anything you need, tell me.” She replied: “Enough. Why should I speak? Even if I needed something, I don’t see at all how it’d be given.” The householder replied: “Just tell me, I’ll give you what you need.” Then she pointed at a cloth worth 1,000 panels of cotton cloth, and said: “I need a cloth like this.” Then the householders were all upset and said: “This bhikkhunī takes without limit. Outwardly, she praises herself: ‘I know the true dhamma’, how is that the true dhamma? Why then does she ask for a cloth worth 1,000 panels of cotton cloth? Even if a supporter offers it, she should still know moderation.” They then took it and gave it, and added: “If I had gone, I could’ve fully taken care of this matter, and I might not have lost this cloth.”

<lzh>時跋陀迦毘羅比丘尼至親里家就座而坐。諸居士問言：「阿姨！何所須欲？」報言：「且止，便為供養我已。」復語言：「但說，欲須何物？」報言：「何須說？正使欲有所須，俱不見與。」報言：「當與，非為不與。但說，欲須何物？」彼即指示價直千張疊衣：「我須此衣。」時諸居士譏嫌言：「比丘尼受取無厭，外自稱言：『我知正法。』如是何有正法？乃索價直千張疊衣，正使檀越施與，猶應知足。」即與衣已，語言：「比丘尼何用此貴價衣為？」</lzh>
Then, Bhaddā Kāpilānī bhikkhunī went to her relatives’ house and sat down on a seat. The householders asked: “Venerable, what do you need or want?” She replied: “Enough. You’ve already offered to me.” They asked again: “Just tell us, what do you want or need?” She replied: “Why should I speak? Even if I wanted some necessity, I don’t see at all how it’d be given.” They replied: “We’ll give it, we won’t not give it. Just tell us, what do you want or need?” Then she pointed at a cloth worth 1,000 panels of cotton cloth, (and said:) “I need this cloth.” Then the householders were upset and said: “This bhikkhunī takes without limit. Outwardly, she praises herself: ‘I know the true dhamma’, how is that the true dhamma? She then asks for a cloth worth 1,000 panels of cotton cloth. Even if a supporter offers it, she should still know moderation.” Then, when they had given her the cloth, they said: “For what purpose is this bhikkhunī going to use this expensive cloth?”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責跋陀迦毘羅比丘尼：「云何比丘尼乃從彼索價直千張疊衣？」時諸比丘尼往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊爾時以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責迦羅跋陀迦毘羅比丘尼：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何乃從彼索價直千張疊衣？」時世尊以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此迦羅跋陀迦毘羅比丘尼！多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義，乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，乞重衣齊價直四張疊，過者尼薩耆波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked Bhaddā Kāpilānī bhikkhunī: “Why, bhikkhunī, did you ask for a cloth worth 1,000 panels of cotton cloth from others?” Then the bhikkhunīs went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized Kālī and Bhaddā Kāpilānī bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you ask for a cloth worth 1,000 panels of cotton cloth from others?” Then, when the World-honored One had criticized them in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These Kālī and Bhaddā Kāpilānī bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī asks for a heavy cloth, it may be worth four panels of cotton cloth. If she exceeds that, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>重衣者，障寒衣也。</lzh>
“A heavy cloth” means a cloth to protect oneself from the cold.

<lzh>衣者，十種如上。</lzh>
“A cloth” means the 10 kinds of cloths, as above.

<lzh>若比丘尼求重衣時，極至十六條。若比丘尼求重衣價直過四張疊者，尼薩耆波逸提。此尼薩耆當捨與僧如上。捨衣竟懺悔如上法。僧即應還彼比丘尼衣，作白二羯磨與如上。僧若不還，若受作五衣，乃至數數著，一切突吉羅如上。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī asks for a heavy cloth, it may consist of up to 16 strips at most. If a bhikkhunī asks for a heavy cloth worth more than four panels of cotton cloth, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. This nissaggiya should be relinquished to the sangha, as above. When she has relinquished the cloth, she should confess as in the rule above. The sangha should then return the cloth to that bhikkhunī, and carry out a formal act with a motion as second to give it back as above. If the sangha doesn’t return it, if they accept it and make the five robes out of it, … or if they frequently wear it, in all cases it’s a dukkaṭa as above.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，索齊四張疊若減，若從出家人乞，若彼為己、己為彼，若不索而自得，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she asks for something worth four panels of cotton cloth or less, if she asks from renunciates, if others ask for her or she asks for others, or if she obtains it without asking, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 29th rule.)

<lzh>(二十九竟)</lzh>
