<h2>First Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>爾時有一比丘尼，欲裁縫僧伽梨。時偷羅難陀比丘尼言：「妹持來！我與汝裁縫。」彼即與衣財。彼比丘尼聰明多知識，善能教化。偷羅難陀比丘尼作是意，欲使彼比丘尼久作供養故，便為裁衣不即為縫成。時偷羅難陀比丘尼所住精舍失火，衣財為火所燒，又為風吹零落。時居士見已皆譏嫌言：「此比丘尼不知慚愧，外自稱言：『我修正法。』如是有何正法？云何比丘尼裁他衣，而不即縫成，為火所燒風吹零落？」</lzh>
Then there was a bhikkhunī who wanted to cut and sew a saṅghāṭī. Thullanandā bhikkhunī said: “Younger sister, bring it (to me). I’ll cut and sew it for you.” She then gave her the valuable cloth. That bhikkhunī was intelligent, had much knowledge, and was able to guide others. Thullanandā bhikkhunī thought that she wanted to make that bhikkhunī give her offerings for a long time. Therefore, she cut the robe, but then didn’t sew it together. Then a fire broke out in the monastery where Thullanandā bhikkhunī was staying. The valuable cloth was burnt by the fire, and then also blown away and scattered by wind. When the householders saw this, they were all upset and said: “These bhikkhunīs know no shame. Outwardly, they praise themselves: ‘We know the true dhamma’, how is that the true dhamma? Why does a bhikkhunī cut another’s robe, but then doesn’t sew it together? It was burnt by fire, and blown away and scattered by wind.”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，呵責偷羅難陀比丘尼言：「汝云何為他作衣，不即縫成，為火所燒風吹零落？」時諸比丘尼白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責偷羅難陀比丘尼：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何比丘尼裁衣不即縫成，為火所燒風吹零落耶？」時世尊以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼縫僧伽梨過五日，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They criticized Thullanandā bhikkhunī: “Why did you, when you were making a robe for someone else, not sew it together? It was burnt by fire, and blown away and scattered by wind.” Then the bhikkhunīs told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized Thullanandā bhikkhunī: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why, bhikkhunī, did you cut cloth, but then not sew it together? It was burnt by fire, and blown away and scattered by wind.” Then, when the World-honored One had criticized her in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “This bhikkhunī has all kinds of taints, and is the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Preliminary Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī takes more than five days to sew a saṇghāṭī, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.


<h2>Second Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>如是世尊與比丘尼結戒，彼求僧伽梨出迦絺那衣，六難事起疑。佛言：「若有如是事無犯。自今已去應如是結戒：若比丘尼縫僧伽梨過五日，除求索僧伽梨出迦絺那衣六難事起者，波逸提。」</lzh>
In this way the World-honored One laid down the precept for the bhikkhunīs. Someone wanted a saṇghāṭī, but the kaṭhina robe was removed and the six difficulties arose. She had doubts. The Buddha said: “If there’s such a case, the offense isn’t committed. From now on, you should recite the precept like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī takes more than five days to sew a saṇghāṭī, except when someone requests a saṇghāṭī, but the kaṭhina robe is removed and the six difficulties arise, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation (continued)</h2>

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，求索僧伽梨出功德衣五日六難事起，若縫若料理時，若無刀無鍼，若無線若少不足，若衣主破戒、破見、破威儀，若被舉、若滅擯、若應滅擯，若由此事故，有命難、梵行難，不縫成過五日者，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if someone requests a saṇghāṭī, but the robe of merit is removed and during the five days the six difficulties arise, if she sews it, if when she attends to it there’s no knive, no needle, or no thread, or just a little and not enough, if the robe’s owner has broken the precepts, or has broken right view, or has broken proper conduct, or has been suspended, has been permanently expelled, or should be permanently expelled, or if for these reasons (the first bhikkhunī’s) life is in danger, or her celibacy is in danger, and she doesn’t sew it together and exceeds five days, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 103rd rule.)
