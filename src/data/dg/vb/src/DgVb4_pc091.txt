<h2>First Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在婆祇陀國。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāketa.

<lzh>時六群比丘尼二人同一褥、同一被共臥。時諸比丘尼見謂與男子共臥，起時乃知非男子。</lzh>
Then the group-of-six bhikkhunīs lay down two together on the same mat and under the same blanket. The householders saw it and said that they were lying down together with a man. When they got up, then they knew that it wasn’t a man.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責六群比丘尼：「云何汝等二人同一褥、同一被共臥？」時諸比丘尼往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊爾時以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責六群比丘尼：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何汝等二人同一褥、同一被共臥耶？」時世尊以無數方便呵責六群比丘尼已，告諸比丘：「此六群比丘尼！多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼二人同一褥、同一被共臥，波逸提。」如是世尊與比丘尼結戒。</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “Why did you lie down two together on the same mat and under the same blanket?” Then the bhikkhunīs went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you lie down two together on the same mat and under the same blanket?” Then, when the World-honored One had criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These group-of-six bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Preliminary Ruling</h2>

‘If bhikkhunīs lie down two together on the same mat and under the same blanket, it’s a pācittiya.’” In this way the World-honored One laid down the precept for the bhikkhunīs.


<h2>Second Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>彼比丘尼有一敷，或是草、或是樹葉，諸比丘尼疑不敢共臥。佛言：「聽諸比丘尼各別敷臥氈，若寒時正有一被，聽各內著襯身衣得共臥。自今已去應如是結戒：若比丘尼共一褥同一被臥，除餘時，波逸提。」</lzh>
Bhikkhunīs had a layer of grass or of tree leaves. They had doubts and didn’t dare to lie down together. The Buddha said: “I allow the bhikkhunīs to each lay out a separate sleeping mat. If during winter, there truly is just one blanket, I allow that each wraps her body in her robes underneath and then they may lie down together. From now on, you should recite the precept like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If bhikkhunīs lie down together on the same mat and under the same blanket, except at the right time, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼二人同一褥、共一被臥，隨脇著床，波逸提。隨轉，一一波逸提。若同一褥別被，突吉羅。若同一被別褥，突吉羅。</lzh>
If bhikkhunīs lie down two together on the same mat and under the same blanket, when they place their flanks on the bed, it’s a pācittiya. When they turn over, each time is a pācittiya. If is is the same mat, but a different blanket, it’s a dukkaṭa. If it’s the same blanket, but a different mat, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，若有一敷、若草、若葉敷，各別敷臥氈；若寒時同一被內各著襯身衣、或病倒地、或為強力者所執、或被繫或命難、或梵行難，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if there’s one layer of grass, or of tree leaves, and each (bhikkhunī) lays out a separate sleeping mat, if during winter there’s one blanket and underneath each one wraps her body in her robes, if she’s sick and falls to the ground, if she’s held by force, if she’s arrested, if her life is in danger, or if her celibacy is in danger, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t been laid down yet, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 91st rule.)
