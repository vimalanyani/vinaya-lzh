<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時佛在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。時安隱比丘尼欲來詣舍衛國。先舊住比丘尼聞安隱比丘尼當來，為往詣家家乞求，大得財物飲食，至期日而彼比丘尼竟不到。舊住比丘尼等自相謂言：「我等與安隱比丘尼共期至舍衛國，而彼不到。比丘尼衣服難得，應辦五衣，我等寧可取此物貿衣共分。」即作五衣分之。後於異時，安隱比丘尼來至舍衛國。夜過已，到時著衣持鉢入舍衛城乞食，時諸居士見即問：「阿姨何所求索？」答言：「乞食。」又問：「眾僧無食耶？」答言：「無。」</lzh>
At that time, the Buddha was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park. Then Khemā bhikkhunī wanted to come to Sāvatthī. When the bhikkhunīs who had already been staying there a long time heard that Khemā bhikkhunī would come, they went from house to house, and asked for and received many goods, drinks and food. The arranged day came, but the bhikkhunī didn’t arrive. The bhikkhunīs who were already staying there said to each other: “We had an appointment with Khemā bhikkhunī to come to Sāvatthī, but she didn’t come. For bhikkhunīs, robes are hard to get, and we should prepare our five robes. We’d better take these things, exchange them for robes, and distribute them.” Then they made the five robes and distributed them. At a later time, Khemā bhikkhunī came to Sāvatthī. When the night was over and the right time had come, she put on her robes, took her bowl, and entered Sāvatthī on almsround. When the householders saw her, they asked: “Venerable, what are you looking for?” She answered: “Almsfood.” They asked again: “Doesn’t the sangha have food?” She answered: “No.”

<lzh>後日居士至舊比丘尼所問言：「我等先各各出物，為供給安隱比丘尼，為作食不？」答言：「不作。」問言：「何故不作。」答言：「我先與安隱比丘尼共期來至舍衛國，而彼不至。我等作是念：『與安隱共期至舍衛國，而彼不到。比丘尼衣服難得，應辦五衣。我等寧可以此物貿衣共分。』即便貿衣共分。」時居士皆共譏嫌言：「此諸比丘尼無有慚愧、受取無厭，外自稱言：『我知正法。』云何先為安隱比丘尼各各出物作飲食，而後貿衣共分。如是何有正法？我等亦知比丘尼衣服難得應具五衣，而我等所以施者，正為安隱遠至供給飲食耳。」</lzh>
On a later day, the householders went to the bhikkhunīs who were already staying there, and asked: “We previously each gave out things to offer to Khemā bhikkhunī. Did you prepare the food or not?” They answered: “We didn’t prepare it.” They asked again: “Why didn’t you prepare it?” They answered: “We previously had an appointment with Khema bhikkhunī to come to Sāvatthī, but she didn’t come. We thought: ‘There was an appointment with Khemā to come to Sāvatthī, but she didn’t come. For bhikkhunīs, robes are hard to get, and we should prepare our five robes. We’d better exchange these things for robes and distribute them.’ Then we exchanged them for robes and distributed them.” Then the householders all were upset and said: “These bhikkhunīs have no shame, they take without limit. Outwardly, they praise themselves: ‘We know the true dhamma’, but when we each previously gave out things to prepare drinks and food for Khemā bhikkhunī, why did they later exchange them for robes and distribute them? How is that the true dhamma? We also know that for bhikkhunīs robes are hard to get, and they should have five robes complete. But we’ve given for a reason, directly for Khemā who is coming from far, to offer her drinks and food.”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，呵責彼比丘尼：「汝等云何居士施物，為供給安隱比丘尼作食，乃貿衣而共分耶？」時諸比丘尼往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊爾時以此因緣集比丘僧呵責彼比丘尼：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何比丘尼，居士施物供給安隱比丘尼作食，而乃貿衣共分？」時世尊以無數方便呵責彼比丘尼已，告諸比丘：「彼比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，所為施物異，自求為僧，迴作餘用者，尼薩耆波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They criticized these bhikkhunīs: “Why did you, when householders have given things to prepare food to offer to Khemā bhikkhunī, exchange them for robes and distribute them?” Then the bhikkhunīs went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized these bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why, bhikkhunīs, did you, when householders have given things to prepare food to offer to Khemā bhikkhunī, exchange them for robes and distribute them?” When the World-honored One had criticized these bhikkhunīs in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī, when an item has been given for a certain purpose, and she has asked for it herself for the sangha, diverts it towards another use, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>所為施異者，若為食施用作衣，為衣施用作食，若為餘處乃更為餘處用。</lzh>
“When an item has been given for a certain purpose” means using what was given for food to make robes, or using what was given for robes to prepare food, or using what was given for one purpose for another purpose.

<lzh>自求者，處處求。</lzh>
“Having asked for it oneself” means asking here and there.

<lzh>僧物者，如上說。</lzh>
“The sangha’s things” are as explained above.

<lzh>若比丘尼，所為施物異，自求為僧迴作餘用者，尼薩耆波逸提。此尼薩耆應捨與僧如上法，捨已懺悔如上。僧即應還彼捨衣，白二羯磨還如上。若不還，受作五衣乃至作非衣，數數著，一切突吉羅如上。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī, when an item has been given for a certain purpose, and she has asked for it herself for the sangha, diverts it towards another use, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. This nissaggiya should be relinquished to the sangha, as in the rule above. When she has relinquished it, she should confess as above. The sangha should then return the relinquished robes to her in a formal act with a motion as second to return them as above. If they don’t return them, if they accept them and make the five robes out of them, … if they turn them into something other than a robe, or if they frequently wear them, in all cases it’s a dukkaṭa as above.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，語居士隨意用，若居士與物已語言隨意用，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she talks to the householders and uses it according to their intention, and if, after the householders have given the item, they say: “Use it as you like,” the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。(二十一竟)</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 21st rule.)
