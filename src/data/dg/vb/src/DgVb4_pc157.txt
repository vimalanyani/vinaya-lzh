<h2>First Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時六群比丘尼，畜婦女莊嚴身具手脚釧及猥處莊嚴具。諸居士見皆共譏嫌言：「此比丘尼，無有慚愧犯梵行，外自稱言：『我知正法。』如是有何正法？乃畜婦女莊嚴身具手脚釧及猥處莊嚴具，如似婬女賊女無異。」</lzh>
Then the group-of-six bhikkhunīs kept women’s bodily ornaments: bracelets for hands and feet, and ornaments for many other places. When the householders saw this, they were all upset and said: “These bhikkhunīs have no shame, they’ve broken celibacy. Outwardly, they praise themselves: ‘We know the true dhamma’, how is that the true dhamma? Then they keep women’s bodily ornaments: bracelets for hands and feet, and ornaments for many other places. There’s no difference to prostitutes and criminals.”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，呵責六群比丘尼言：「汝等云何乃畜婦女莊嚴身具手脚釧及猥處莊嚴具耶？」即白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責六群比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何比丘尼畜婦女莊嚴身具手脚釧及猥處莊嚴具？」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼畜婦女莊嚴具者，波逸提。」如是世尊與比丘尼結戒。</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “Why did you keep women’s bodily ornaments: bracelets for hands and feet, and ornaments for many other places?” Then they told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why, bhikkhunīs, did you keep women’s bodily ornaments: bracelets for hands and feet, and ornaments for many other places?” When he had criticized them in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Preliminary Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī keeps women’s bodily ornaments, it’s a pācittiya.’” In this way the World-honored One laid down the precept for the bhikkhunīs.


<h2>Second Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>時諸比丘尼，有命難、梵行難，有疑不敢著莊嚴身具走。佛言：「自今已去若命難、梵行難，聽著莊嚴身具走。自今已去當如是結戒：若比丘尼，畜婦女莊嚴身具，除時因緣，波逸提。」</lzh>
Then the bhikkhunīs’ lives were in danger, or their celibacy was in danger. They had doubts and didn’t dare to wear bodily ornaments to escape. The Buddha said: “From now on, if your lives are in danger, or your celibacy is in danger, I allow to wear bodily ornaments to escape. From now on, you should recite the precept like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī keeps women’s bodily ornaments, except at a suitable time for a good reason, it’s a pācittiya.’”

<lzh>若比丘尼，畜婦女莊嚴身具，手脚釧猥處莊嚴具，乃至樹皮作鬘，一切波逸提。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī keeps women’s bodily ornaments: bracelets for hands and feet, and ornaments for many other places, even just tree bark made into a garland, in all cases it’s a pācittiya.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，或有如是病，若命難、梵行難，著莊嚴具逃走，或為強力者所執，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she has a certain illness, if her life is in danger, or if her celibacy is in danger and she wears ornaments to escape, or if she’s held by force, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 157th rule.)
