<h2>First Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時世尊制戒聽百歲比丘尼見新受戒比丘，當起迎逆禮拜、恭敬問訊、與敷坐具。然彼諸比丘尼，不起迎逆禮拜恭敬問訊。</lzh>
Then the World-honored One had laid down a precept and allowed that a bhikkhunī of 100 years (of seniority) who sees a newly-ordained bhikkhu should get up to welcome him, pay respect, be respectful, greet him, and lay out a sitting mat. Then the bhikkhunīs didn’t get up, welcome him, pay respect, weren’t respectful, and didn’t greet him.

<lzh>諸比丘尼聞，中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責諸比丘尼言：「云何世尊制戒聽百歲比丘尼見新受戒比丘，應起迎逆、恭敬禮拜問訊、與敷坐具。云何不起迎逆耶？」即白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責諸比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何汝等，百歲比丘尼見新受戒比丘，不起迎逆禮拜、恭敬問訊、與敷坐具？」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若百歲比丘尼見新受戒比丘，應起迎逆恭敬禮拜問訊，若不者，波逸提。」如是世尊與比丘尼結戒。</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked these bhikkhunīs: “The World-honored One has laid down a precept and allowed that a bhikkhunī of 100 years (of seniority) who sees a newly-ordained bhikkhu should get up to welcome him, be respectful, pay respect, greet him, and lay out a sitting mat. Why did you not get up to welcome him?” Then they told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized these bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you, bhikkhunīs of 100 years (of seniority), when you saw a newly-ordained bhikkhu, not get up to welcome him, pay respect, be respectful, greet him, and lay out a sitting mat?” When he had criticized them in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Preliminary Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī of 100 years (of seniority) sees a newly ordained bhikkhu, she should get up to welcome him, be respectful, pay respect, and greet him. If she doesn’t, it’s a pācittiya.’” In this way the World-honored One laid down the precept for the bhikkhunīs.


<h2>Second Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>或有一坐食，不作餘食法食，或有病者，或有足食者，而不起疑。佛言：「自今已去聽語言：『大德懺悔，我有如是如是因緣不得起迎逆。』自今已去當如是說戒：若比丘尼，見新受戒比丘，應起迎逆恭敬、禮拜問訊、請與坐，不者除因緣，波逸提。」</lzh>
There were some who ate in one session, who ate without carrying out the procedure for leftover food, who were sick, or who had enough food. They didn’t get up and had doubts. The Buddha said: “From now on, I allow to say: ‘Venerable, I’m sorry, I’ve such-and-such a reason and am not able to get up and welcome you.’ From now on, you should recite the precept like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī sees a newly ordained bhikkhu, she should get up to welcome him, be respectful, pay respect, greet him, and invite him to sit down. If she doesn’t, unless there’s a reason, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼，見比丘不起，除因緣，波逸提。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī sees a bhikkhu and doesn’t get up, unless there’s a reason, it’s a pācittiya.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，若起迎逆，或一坐食，或不作餘食法食，或病或足食語言：「大德忍，我有如是如是因緣。」或病倒地、或為強力所執，或命難、梵行難者，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she gets up to welcome him, if she eats in one session, if she eats without carrying out the procedure for leftover food, if she’s sick, or if she has enough food, and says: “May the venerable accept it, I’ve such-and-such a reason,” if she’s sick and falls to the ground, if she’s held by force, if her life is in danger, or if her celibacy is in danger, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 175th rule.)
