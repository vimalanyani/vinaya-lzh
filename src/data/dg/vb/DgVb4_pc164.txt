<h2>First Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時有比丘尼不夏安居。</lzh>
Then there were bhikkhunīs who didn’t enter the rains retreat.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，呵責諸比丘尼言：「云何不夏安居耶？」即白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責諸比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何比丘尼不夏安居？」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼不夏安居者，波逸提。」如是世尊與比丘尼結戒。</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They criticized these bhikkhunīs: “Why didn’t you enter the rains retreat?” Then they told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized these bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why, bhikkhunīs, didn’t you enter the rains retreat?” When he had criticized them in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Preliminary Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī doesn’t enter the rains retreat, it’s a pācittiya.’” In this way the World-honored One laid down the precept for the bhikkhunīs.


<h2>Second Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>時諸比丘尼，有為佛法僧事、或看病事，不及安居疑。佛言：「自今已去聽有如是因緣後安居。自今已去當如是說戒：若比丘尼，不前安居不後安居者，波逸提。」</lzh>
Then the bhikkhunīs had matters of the Buddha, the dhamma, and the sangha to attend to, or they looked after the sick. They didn’t enter the rains retreat and had doubts. The Buddha said: “From now on, I allow to enter the later rains retreat for such reasons. From now on, you should recite the precept like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī neither enters the earlier, nor the later rains retreat, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>若比丘尼，不前安居者，突吉羅。不後安居者，波逸提。</lzh>
When a bhikkhunī doesn’t enter the earlier rains retreat, it’s a dukkaṭa. When she doesn’t enter the later rains retreat, it’s a pācittiya.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，前安居；或為佛法僧事、或瞻視病人，受後安居，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she enters the earlier rains retreat, or if she attends to matters of the Buddha, the dhamma, and the sangha, or looks after the sick, and enters the later rains retreat, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 164th rule.)
