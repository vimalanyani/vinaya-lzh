<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時佛在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。時世穀米勇貴，乞求難得。時諸比丘尼入城乞食空鉢而還，堤舍難陀比丘尼亦入城乞食空鉢而還。諸比丘尼見已問堤舍比丘尼言：「汝常乞食滿鉢而歸，今何以空鉢而歸，乞求難得耶？」答言：「實爾。」問言：「何以故爾？」答言：「諸妹！我前常詣販賣人乞故易得，而今不往從乞，是以難得。」時六群比丘尼偷羅難陀及堤舍比丘尼母，語堤舍比丘尼言：「正使彼有染污心、無染污心，能那汝何？汝自無染污心，若得食，但以時清淨受取。」時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責六群偷羅難陀及堤舍比丘尼母言：「汝等云何語堤舍比丘尼言：『正使彼染污心、無染污心，能那汝何？汝自無染污心，若得食，但以時清淨受。』」</lzh>
At that time, the Buddha was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park. Then, grain and rice had become very expensive in the world, and almsfood was hard to get. The bhikkhunīs entered the city on almsround and returned with empty bowls, and Tissanandā bhikkhunī also entered the city on almsround and returned with an empty bowl. When the bhikkhunīs saw her, they asked her: “You always returned from almsround with a full bowl. Why do you return now with an empty bowl? Is almsfood hard to get?” She answered: “Yes.” They asked: “Why?” She answered: “Younger sisters, because I previously always went to a merchant for alms, I easily got it, but now I don’t go to him for alms, therefore it’s hard to get.” Then the group-of-six bhikkhunīs, Thullanandā, and Tissā bhikkhunī’s mother said to Tissā bhikkhunī: “Whether he has a defiled mind or an undefiled mind, what does it matter to you? You yourself have an undefiled mind. If you receive food, just accept it at the right time in purity.” When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked the group-of-six, Thullanandā, and Tissā bhikkhunī’s mother: “Why do you say to Tissā bhikkhunī: ‘Whether he has a defiled mind or an undefiled mind, what does it matter to you? You yourself have an undefiled mind. If you receive food, just accept it at the right time in purity.’”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊爾時以此因緣集諸比丘僧，呵責六群偷羅難陀及堤舍比丘尼母：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何汝等語堤舍比丘尼言：『正使彼有染污心、無染污心，能那汝何？汝自無染污心，若得食，但以時清淨受。』」時世尊以無數方便呵責六群偷羅難陀及堤舍比丘尼母已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，教比丘尼作如是語：『大姊！彼有染污心、無染污心，能那汝何？汝自無染污心，於彼若得食，以時清淨受取。』此比丘尼犯初法應捨，僧伽婆尸沙。」</lzh>
Then the bhikkhunīs told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized the group-of-six, Thullanandā, and Tissā bhikkhunī’s mother: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why do you say to Tissā bhikkhunī: ‘Whether he has a defiled mind or an undefiled mind, what does it matter to you? You yourself have an undefiled mind. If you receive food, just accept it at the right time in purity.’” When he had criticized the group-of-six, Thullanandā, and Tissā bhikkhunī’s mother in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī teaches another bhikkhunī by saying: “Venerable sister, whether he has a defiled mind or an undefiled mind, what does it matter to you? You yourself have an undefiled mind. If you receive food from him, accept it at the right time in purity,” that bhikkhunī commits an immediate offense that should be given up, a saṅghādisesa.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼語比丘尼言：「大姊！正使彼人有染污心、無染污心，能那汝何？汝自無染污心，若得食，但以時清淨受取。」說而了了，僧伽婆尸沙；說不了了者，偷蘭遮。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī says to another bhikkhunī: “Venerable sister, whether he has a defiled mind or an undefiled mind, what does it matter to you? You yourself have an undefiled mind. If you receive food, just accept it at the right time in purity,” and if she speaks and the other understands, it’s a saṅghādisesa. If she speaks and the other doesn’t understand, it’s a thullaccaya.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，或戲笑說，若疾疾說，獨處說夢中說，欲說此錯說彼，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she says it jokingly, if she speaks quickly, if she speaks in a place where she’s alone, if she speaks in a dream, or if she wants to say one thing but by mistake says something else, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。(九竟)</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the ninth rule.)
