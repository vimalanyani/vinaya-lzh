<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時六群比丘尼，在村內街巷中屏處，與男子共立共語，若遣伴遠去獨與男子耳語。時諸居士見皆共譏嫌言：「此比丘尼，不知慚愧、犯梵行，外自稱言：『我知正法。』如是有何正法？云何比丘尼，入村內街巷中屏處，與男子共立共語，若遣伴遠去獨與男子耳語，如似婬女賊女無異？」</lzh>
Then the group-of-six bhikkhunīs stood and spoke together with men in a secluded place in the streets of a village, and they sent their companions away and whispered in the men’s ears alone. When the householders saw it, they were all upset and said: “These bhikkhunīs know no shame and they break their celibacy. Outwardly, they praise themselves: ‘We know the true dhamma’, how is that the true dhamma? Why do bhikkhunīs enter a secluded place in the streets of the village, stand and speak together with men, and send their companions away and whisper in the men’s ears alone? There’s no difference to prostitutes and criminals.”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責六群比丘尼：「汝等云何入村，在巷陌中屏處與男子耳語？」時諸比丘尼往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責六群比丘尼：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何比丘尼，入村內巷陌中屏處獨與男子耳語？」時世尊以無數方便呵責六群比丘尼已，告諸比丘：「此六群比丘尼！多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，入村內巷陌中遣伴遠去，在屏處與男子共立耳語者，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “Why did you enter a village and whisper into men’s ears in a secluded place in the streets?” Then the bhikkhunīs went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why, bhikkhunīs, did you enter a village and whisper into men’s ears alone in a secluded place in the streets?” Then, when the World-honored One had criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These group-of-six bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī enters a village, sends away her companion in the streets, stands together with a man in a secluded place, and whispers in his ear, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>村者，白衣舍巷陌。</lzh>
“A village” means lay homes and streets.

<lzh>屏處者，有見屏處、聞屏處。見屏處者，烟雲、霧塵、黑闇眼所不見。聞屏處者，乃至常語不聞聲也。</lzh>
“A secluded place” means a place out of sight and earshot. “A place out of sight” means the eye can’t see because of smoke, clouds, fog, dust, or darkness. “A place out of earshot” means down to not hearing the sound of normal speech.

<lzh>耳語者，耳邊語。</lzh>
“Whispering in his ear” means speaking next to the ear.

<lzh>彼比丘尼，入村巷陌中遣伴至不見不聞處，在屏處與男子共立共耳語，波逸提。離見處至聞處，突吉羅。離聞處至見處，突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī enters a village, sends away her companion in the streets, goes to a place out of sight and earshot, stands together with a man in a secluded place and whispers in his ear, it’s a pācittiya. If she is in a place out of sight but within earshot, it’s a dukkaṭa. If she is in a place out of earshot but within sight, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，若二比丘尼為伴，或與可知女人為伴，或有餘人為伴，若伴不盲不聾，或病發倒地，或為強力者所執，或被縛將去，或命難、梵行難，若有所與遣伴遠去，若伴病，若無威儀，而語言：「妹汝去！我當送食與汝。」若破戒、破見、破威儀，若被舉、若應滅擯，若以此事有命難、梵行難，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if there are two bhikkhunīs as companions, if she has a knowledgeable woman as companion, if she has another person as companion and if the companion is not blind and not deaf, if an illness has arisen and she falls to the ground, if she’s held by force, if she’s arrested and made to go, if her life is in danger, if her celibacy is in danger, if she sends her companion away because something is to be delivered, if the companion is sick, or doesn’t have proper conduct, and she says: “Younger sister, go! I’ll send food for you”, if she breaks the precepts, breaks right view, breaks proper conduct, if she’s suspended, if she should be permanently expelled, or if because of this matter her life is in danger or her celibacy is in danger, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 82nd rule.)
