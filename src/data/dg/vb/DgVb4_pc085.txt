<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時有眾多比丘尼道路行向拘薩羅國，詣一無住處村。到已不語主人，便自敷坐具於中止宿。諸居士見問言：「誰安此諸比丘尼在中止宿？」答言：「無有安者，自來止住。」時諸居士譏嫌言：「此比丘尼不知慚愧，外自稱言：『我知正法。』如是有何正法？云何比丘尼，不語其主，便入他舍輒自安止，與婬女賊女何異？」</lzh>
Then there was a group of bhikkhunīs who were walking on a road towards the country of Kosala and had reached a village without a resthouse. When they had arrived (at someone’s house), they laid out sitting mat to stay overnight there by themselves without telling the owner. When the householders saw it, they asked: “Who has arranged for these bhikkhunīs to stay overnight there?” They answered: “Nobody has arranged it. They came by themselves and settled there.” Then the householders were upset and said: “These bhikkhunīs know no shame. Outwardly, they praise themselves: ‘We know the true dhamma’, how is that the true dhamma? Why does a bhikkhunī, without telling the owner, enter their house, and just arrange to stay there herself? What’s the difference to prostitutes and criminals?”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責諸比丘尼：「云何比丘尼，不語主人輒入他舍坐臥止宿？」時諸比丘尼往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊爾時以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責此諸比丘尼：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何比丘尼，不語主人輒入他舍止宿坐臥？」時世尊以無數方便呵責此比丘尼已，告諸比丘：「此諸比丘尼，多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼，入白衣家內，不語主人輒自敷座宿者，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked these bhikkhunīs: “Why, bhikkhunīs, did you, without telling the owner, just enter their house, and sit and lie down to stay overnight?” Then the bhikkhunīs went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized these bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why, bhikkhunīs, did you, without telling the owner, just enter their house, and stay overnight sitting and lying down?” Then, when the World-honored One had criticized these bhikkhunīs in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī enters a lay house, and without telling the owner, just lays out seats to stay overnight, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>敷座者，或敷草、或敷樹葉乃至敷臥氈。</lzh>
“Laying out seats” means laying out grass, or tree leaves, … or a sleeping mat.

<lzh>彼比丘尼，入白衣舍內，不語主人自敷座具宿止，隨脇著地，若一轉一波逸提。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī enters a lay house and, without telling the owner, lays out sitting mat by herself to stay overnight, whenever her flanks touch the ground, each time she turns over is a pācittiya.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，語主人宿止，若是空舍、或作福舍、或是知識，若有親厚者語言：「汝但坐，我當與汝語主人。」或強力者所執、或被縛、或命難、梵行難，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she tells the owner and stays overnight, if it’s an empty house, if it’s a house for making merit, if it’s an aquaintance, if there’s a friend who says: “Just sit down, I’ll tell the owner about you”, if she’s held by force, if she’s arrested, if her life is in danger, or if her celibacy is in danger, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 85th rule.)
