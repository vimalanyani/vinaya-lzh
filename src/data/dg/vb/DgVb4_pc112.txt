<h2>First Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時跋難陀釋子有二沙彌：一名耳、二名蜜，一人罷道、一人著袈裟入外道眾。時六群比丘尼，持食與白衣、入外道者。</lzh>
Then Upananda the Sakyan had two sāmaṇeras, one called “Ear” and the other called “Honey”. One of them disrobed and the other joined a group of non-Buddhist renunciates while wearing the monastic robe. Then the group-of-six bhikkhunīs took food and gave it to the lay person and the one who had joined non-Buddhist renunciates. 

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，呵責六群比丘尼言：「汝云何持食與白衣、入外道者？」時諸比丘尼白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責六群比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何汝等持食與白衣、入外道者？」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼與白衣、入外道者可噉食者，波逸提。」如是世尊與比丘尼結戒。</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “Why did you take food and give it to a lay person and to someone who has joined non-Buddhist renunciates?” Then the bhikkhunīs told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha and criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you take food and give it to a lay person and to someone who has joined non-Buddhist renunciates?” When he had criticized them in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Preliminary Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī gives edibles<note> khādanīya</note> to a lay person or to someone who has joined non-Buddhist renunciates, it’s a pācittiya.’” In this way the World-honored One laid down the precept for the bhikkhunīs.


<h2>Second Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>彼疑不敢置地與，不敢使人與。佛言：「聽使人與、若置地與。自今已去當如是說戒：若比丘尼自手持食與白衣、入外道食者，波逸提。」</lzh>
They had doubts and didn’t dare to give it by placing it on the ground, and didn’t dare to have others give it. The Buddha said: “I allow to have others give it, or to give it by placing it on the ground. From now on, you should recite the precept like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī takes food with her own hands and gives it to a lay person or to someone who has joined non-Buddhist renunciates to eat, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>白衣者，未出家人。</lzh>
“Lay person” means a person who hasn’t yet gone forth.

<lzh>外道者，在佛法外出家者是。</lzh>
“Non-Buddhist renunciates” means people gone forth outside the Buddha’s dhamma.

<lzh>可食噉者，如上。</lzh>
“Edibles” is as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼自手持食與白衣、入外道，此與彼受者，波逸提。不受者，突吉羅。方便欲與而不與、若期當與悔不與，一切突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī takes food with her own hands and gives it to a lay person or to someone who has joined non-Buddhist renunciates, and if she gives and someone else accepts it, it’s a pācittiya. If the other doesn’t accept it, it’s a dukkaṭa. If she plans and want to give, but doesn’t give, or if she promises that she’ll give, but regrets it and doesn’t give, in all cases it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>比丘，波逸提；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a pācittiya. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，或置地與、或使人與、若與父母、若與塔作人、若為強力者所奪，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she gives it by placing it on the ground, if she has others give it, if she gives it to her parents, if she gives it to people building a stupa, or if it’s snatched by force, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 112th rule.)
