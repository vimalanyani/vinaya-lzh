<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時六群比丘尼乞求生穀、胡麻、米、若大小豆、大小麥。時諸居士見已譏嫌言：「諸比丘尼乞求無厭、不知慚愧，外自稱言：『我知正法。』如是有何正法？乃乞如是等種種生穀米，似如婬女賊女無異。」</lzh>
Then the group-of-six bhikkhunīs asked for raw grain, sesame, and rice, or for beans and oats of various sizes. When the householders saw them, they were upset and said: These bhikkhunīs ask without limit and they know no shame. Outwardly, they praise themselves: ‘We know the true dhamma’, how is that the true dhamma? Then they ask like this for all kinds of raw grain and rice, there’s no difference to prostitutes and criminals.”

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，其中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者，嫌責六群比丘尼言：「云何汝等乞是種種生穀米？」時諸比丘尼往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。時世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責六群比丘尼：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何汝等乞是種種生穀米？」時世尊以無數方便呵責六群比丘尼已，告諸比丘：「此六群比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼乞生穀者，波逸提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They rebuked the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “Why did you ask for all kinds of raw grain and rice?” Then the bhikkhunīs went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One then for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha, and criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you ask for all kinds of raw grain and rice?” Then, when the World-honored One had criticized the group-of-six bhikkhunīs in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These group-of-six bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: ‘If a bhikkhunī asks for raw grain, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼乞生穀乃至大小麥，一切波逸提。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī asks for raw grain, … oats of various sizes, in all cases it’s a pācittiya.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅；式叉摩那、沙彌、沙彌尼，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. For a sikkhamānā, a sāmaṇera, and a sāmaṇerī, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，若從親里乞，若從出家人乞，若他為己、己為他，若不乞自得者，不犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she asks from relatives, if she asks from renunciates, if others ask for her, if she asks for others, or if she obtains it without asking, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>不犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 76th rule.)
