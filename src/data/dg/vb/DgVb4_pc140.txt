<h2>First Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時婆伽婆在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨園。</lzh>
At that time, the Blessed One was in Sāvatthī in Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s park.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼，教授日不往受教授。</lzh>
Then the bhikkhunīs didn’t go to receive instruction on the instruction day.

<lzh>時諸比丘尼聞，中有少欲知足、行頭陀、樂學戒、知慚愧者呵責諸比丘尼言：「汝等教授日，云何不往受教授？」即往白諸比丘，諸比丘往白世尊。世尊以此因緣集比丘僧，呵責諸比丘尼言：「汝所為非，非威儀、非沙門法、非淨行、非隨順行，所不應為。云何汝等，教授日不來入眾中受教授耶？」以無數方便呵責已，告諸比丘：「此比丘尼多種有漏處，最初犯戒。自今已去與比丘尼結戒，集十句義乃至正法久住，欲說戒者當如是說：若比丘尼教授日不往受教授者，波逸提。」如是世尊與比丘尼結戒。</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, there were among them those with few wishes, who knew moderation, who practised the austerities, who were keen on training in the precepts, and who knew shame. They criticized these bhikkhunīs: “Why did you not go to receive instruction on the instruction day?” Then they went and told the bhikkhus, and the bhikkhus went and told the World-honored One. The World-honored One for this reason gathered the bhikkhu sangha and criticized these bhikkhunīs: “What you did is wrong, is improper conduct, against the rules of renunciates, an impure practice, a practice not to be followed, shouldn’t be done. Why did you not come to the sangha to receive instruction on the instruction day?” When he had criticized them in countless ways, he said to the bhikkhus: “These bhikkhunīs have all kinds of taints, and are the first to break this precept. From now on, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs, and state the 10 principles: … So that the true dhamma may last long. Someone wishing to recite the precept should recite like this: 


<h2>Preliminary Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī doesn’t go to receive instruction on the instruction day, it’s a pācittiya.’” In this way the World-honored One laid down the precept for the bhikkhunīs.


<h2>Second Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>時諸比丘尼有佛事、法事、僧事，或瞻病事。佛言：「聽囑授。自今已去當如是結戒：若比丘尼，不病，不往受教授者，波逸提。」</lzh>
Then the bhikkhunīs had matters of the Buddha, the dhamma, and the sangha, or they looked after the sick. The Buddha said: “I allow to inform the others. From now on, you should recite the precept like this: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī who isn’t sick doesn’t go to receive instruction, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼義如上。</lzh>
The meaning of “bhikkhunī” is as above.

<lzh>彼比丘尼，不往受教授，除餘事，波逸提。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī doesn’t go to receive instruction, unless she’s doing a suitable activity, it’s a pācittiya.

<lzh>比丘，突吉羅。是謂為犯。</lzh>
For a bhikkhu, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “to commit”.

<lzh>不犯者，教授時往受教授，佛法僧事及瞻視病人囑授，無犯。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she goes to receive instruction at the time of instruction, or if she has matters of the Buddha, the dhamma, and the sangha, or looks after the sick, and informs someone, the offense isn’t committed.

<lzh>無犯者，最初未制戒，癡狂、心亂、痛惱所纏。</lzh>
“Not committed” means if she’s the first offender when the precept hadn’t yet been laid down, if she’s mad, if she’s distracted, or if she’s overcome with pain. (End of the 140th rule.)
