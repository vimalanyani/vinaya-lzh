Origin Story


<beginchinese>佛住舍衛城。爾時伽梨比丘尼受僧房已閉戶而去。後客比丘尼上座來次第與房。見戶閉即嫌言。此僧房舍何以閉戶而去。
諸比丘尼語大愛道。乃至佛言呼是比丘尼來。來已問言。汝實爾不。答言實爾。佛言。此是惡事。乃至汝云何僧房舍不捨閉戶而行。從今已後不聽。佛告大愛道。依止舍衛城比丘尼皆悉令集。乃至已聞者當重聞。<endchinese>

The Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī. At that time, Kālī bhikkhunī, after having been assigned a sangha room, locked the door and went away. Then senior guest bhikkhunīs arrived, and were given rooms in order of their seniority. When they saw that the door was locked, they were upset and said: “In a sangha building, how can you lock the door, and go away?”
The bhikkhunīs told Mahāpajāpatī, … The Buddha said: “Summon that bhikkhunī.” When she came, he asked her: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this.” The Buddha said: “This is an unwholesome thing. … Why did you not give up your room in a sangha building, lock the door, and go away? From now on, it’s no longer allowed.” The Buddha told Mahāpajāpatī: “Convene all the bhikkhunīs living in the vicinity of Sāvatthī. … Those who have already heard it should listen again:




Final Ruling


<beginchinese>若比丘尼僧房床褥不捨而去波夜提。<endchinese>

If a bhikkhunī goes away without giving up her bed and her mat in a sangha room, it’s a pācittiya.”




Explanation


<beginchinese>比丘尼者如上說。僧床褥者坐床臥床枕褥拘執。不捨者不還不白。餘處去者波夜提。波夜提者如上說。若比丘尼欲行去。當捨床褥。與知床褥人已而去。若不捨而去者波夜提。若房不空。尋有人住者越毘尼罪。是故世尊說。<endchinese>

“A bhikkhunī” is as explained above. “The sangha’s bed and mat” means seats, beds, pillows, mats, and blankets. “Not giving up” means not returning, and not telling someone. If she goes to another place, is a pācittiya. “Pācittiya” is as explained above. If a bhikkhunī wants to go away, she should give up her bed and mat, or inform the person in charge of beds and mats before leaving. If she doesn’t give them up and goes away, it’s a pācittiya. If the room isn’t empty, and others still live there, she breaks a minor vinaya rule. This is what the World-honored One said.
