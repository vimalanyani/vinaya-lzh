<lzh>比丘尼八敬法</lzh>
<h2>The bhikkhunīs’ eight rules of respect.</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼布薩日到寺中，隨意請一比丘，受教誡法。比丘尼僧要當自和合，僧差一比丘尼，來受教誡，要須伴共來。來到已，頭面禮教誡比丘足問訊，應如是語：「比丘尼僧和合，頭面禮和合比丘僧足，乞半月教誡法。所勅教誡法，我當受持。」比丘應語比丘尼言：「釋迦牟尼佛多陀阿伽度、阿羅呵、三藐三佛陀，知者、見者，為比丘尼說半月八敬法。何等八？</lzh>
On the uposatha day, the bhikkhunīs go to the monastery, invite one bhikkhu as they please, and receive instruction in the dhamma. The bhikkhunī sangha needs to be harmonious. The sangha chooses one bhikkhunī to come and receive the instruction. She must come together with a companion. Having arrived, she pays respect with her head at the instructor bhikkhu’s feet, greets him, and should say: “The harmonious bhikkhunī sangha pays respect with their heads at the harmonious bhikkhu sangha’s feet, and asks for the half-monthly instruction in the dhamma. As the instruction in the dhamma is given, we’ll receive and remember it.” The bhikkhu should tell the bhikkhunī: “Sakyamuni Buddha, the Tathāgata, accomplished, and rightly and fully awakened, the one who knows, the one who sees, has half-monthly spoken eight rules of respect for the bhikkhunīs. Which eight?

<lzh>一者百歲比丘尼，見新受具戒比丘，應一心謙敬禮足。</lzh>
1) A bhikkhunī of a hundred years seniority who sees a newly-ordained bhikkhu should single-mindedly and humbly pay respect at his feet.

<lzh>二者比丘尼應從比丘僧乞受具戒。</lzh>
2) A bhikkhunī should ask for full ordination from the bhikkhu sangha.<note> In other schools, she asks from both sanghas.</note>

<lzh>三者若比丘尼犯僧殘罪，應從二部僧乞半月摩那埵法。</lzh>
3) If a bhikkhunī commits a saṅghādisesā offense, she should ask for the procedure of probation<note> mānatta</note> for half a month from both sanghas. 

<lzh>四者無比丘住處，比丘尼不得安居。</lzh>
4) A bhikkhunī may not spend the rains retreat in a place where no bhikkhus live.

<lzh>五者比丘尼安居竟，應從二部僧中自恣求見聞疑罪。</lzh>
5) A bhikkhunī who has finished the rains retreat should invite both sanghas in regard to seen, heard, or suspected offenses.

<lzh>六者比丘尼半月從比丘受八敬法。</lzh>
6) A bhikkhunī should receive the eight rules of respect from the bhikkhus every half-month.

<lzh>七者比丘尼語比丘言：『聽我問修多羅、毘尼、阿毘曇。』比丘聽者應問，若不聽者不得問。</lzh>
7) A bhikkhunī should say to a bhikkhu: “Allow me to ask about suttas, vinaya, or abhidhamma.” If the bhikkhu allows it, she should ask. If he doesn’t allow it, she may not ask.

<lzh>八者比丘尼不得說比丘見聞疑罪。是為八。」</lzh>
8) A bhikkhunī may not speak of a bhikkhu’s seen, heard, or suspected offenses. These are the eight.”<note> Unlike other schools, this text doesn’t mention sikkhamānās, or a two-year training period.</note> 

<lzh>一比丘尼受是八敬法，布薩時應白比丘尼僧中說是八敬法。布薩竟至明日，是先受八敬法比丘尼，應還來禮是教誡比丘足。比丘尼僧和合，頭面禮和合比丘僧足，比丘尼僧和合布薩竟。</lzh>
One bhikkhunī receives these eight rules of respect. At the uposatha time, she should address the bhikkhunī sangha and recite these eight rules of respect. After the uposatha, on the next day, the bhikkhunī who has previously received the eight rules of respect, should return and pay respect at the instructor bhikkhu’s feet: “The harmonious bhikkhunī sangha pays respect with their heads at the harmonious bhikkhu sangha’s feet. The harmonious bhikkhunī sangha has completed the uposatha.”

<lzh>次說比丘法，僧和合說戒時，是教誡比丘尼比丘，若聞說戒比丘言：「僧今和合先作何事？」是受教誡比丘尼比丘，應至上座所偏袒右肩胡跪合掌：「比丘尼僧和合，頭面禮和合比丘僧足，乞半月教誡法所勅教誡法，我當都受。」上座應語：「和合比丘尼僧，不須作教誡羯磨。」是比丘還語比丘尼：「眾僧語汝：『和合比丘尼僧教誡比丘尼羯磨，佛已捨。』」凡教誡比丘尼比丘，不得出界外。若出界外，得突吉羅罪。</lzh>
Below, the bhikkhu rule is explained. When the harmonious sangha is reciting the precepts, and when that bhikkhu who instructs the bhikkhunīs hears the bhikkhu who recites the precepts say: “The sangha is now in harmony. What should be done first?”, he should go to the most senior bhikkhu, uncover his right shoulder, kneel down, join his palms, and say: “The harmonious bhikkhunī sangha pays respect with their heads at the harmonious bhikkhu sangha’s feet and asks for the half-monthly instruction in the dhamma. As the instruction in the dhamma is given, (they) will receive it.” The senior bhikkhu should say: “A harmonious bhikkhunī sangha doesn’t need to carry out the formal act of instruction.” That bhikkhu should return to the bhikkhunī: “The sangha tells you: ‘The Buddha has rescinded the formal act of instruction of bhikkhunīs for a harmonious bhikkhunī sangha.’”<note> Presumably, this just means that the saṅghakamma doesn’t need to be performed. The instruction as such is still done. Other than this passage here, I can’t find anything in the canonical Sarvāstivāda vinaya (T1435) that mentions the saṅghakamma or the instruction being rescinded.</note> All bhikkhus instructing bhikkhunīs may not leave the boundary. If they leave the boundary, they incur a dukkaṭa offense.
