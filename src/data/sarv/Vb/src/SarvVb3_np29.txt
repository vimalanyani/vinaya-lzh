<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時有比丘尼，名達摩提那，於冬八夜寒風破竹時，著單薄衣行乞食。有估客見是比丘尼，往語諸鬪將言：「汝得富樂，皆由達摩提那比丘尼因緣，汝等不能各各與比丘尼作厚衣耶？是比丘尼今冬八夜寒風破竹時，著單衣行乞食，汝等若不能各各作一衣與者，當共合作一衣與。」估客令其發憍慢心故，皆言：「當共作與。」即喚比丘尼言：「汝須何衣？隨汝意與。」是比丘尼言：「我須五百錢直衣。」時諸鬪將隨意買與。是比丘尼著貴價衣行乞食，諸居士呵責言：「諸比丘尼自言：『善好有功德。』著貴價衣行乞食，如王夫人、大臣婦。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, a bhikkhunī called Dhammadinnā, during the eight nights of winter, in the cold wind that breaks bamboo, wore a single-layered, thin robe to go on almsround. A merchant saw this bhikkhunī, went to the generals, and said: “You’ve obtained prosperity because of bhikkhunī Dhammadinnā. Can’t you each make a thick robe for the bhikkhunī? This bhikkhunī now during the eight nights of winter, in the cold wind that breaks bamboo, wears a single-layered robe to go on almsround. If you can’t each make one robe for her, you should make one robe together and give it.” Because the merchant caused pride to arise in their minds, they all said: “We’ll make one together and give it.” Then they summoned the bhikkhunī and said: “What kind of robe do you need? We’ll give as you wish.” The bhikkhunī said: “I need a robe worth 500 coins.” Then the generals bought it according to her wish and gave it. This bhikkhunī wore the expensive robe to go on almsround. The householders criticized her: “These bhikkhunīs say of themselves: ‘We’re virtuous and have merit’, but they wear an expensive robe to go on almsround, like queens and wives of high officials.”

<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，著貴價衣行乞食？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問達摩提那比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責：「云何名比丘尼，著貴價衣行乞食？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼欲乞重衣，乃至直四錢應乞。若過是乞者，尼薩耆波夜提。」</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized her: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you wear an expensive robe to go on almsround?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked Dhammadinnā bhikkhunī: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you wear an expensive robe to go on almsround?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī wants to ask for a heavy robe, she should ask for one up to a value of four coins. If she asks for a more expensive one, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>錢者，謂大錢乃至直十六小錢。</lzh>
“A coin” means a large coin, up to a value of sixteen small coins.

<lzh>尼薩耆波夜提者，是衣應捨，波夜提罪應悔過。</lzh>
“A nissaggiya pācittiya” means that this robe should be relinquished, and the pācittiya offense should be confessed.

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼乞過四錢重衣，尼薩耆波夜提。隨乞，隨得爾所尼薩耆波夜提。(二十九事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī asks for a heavy robe that’s worth more than four coins, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. Whenever she asks, she incurs a nissaggiya pācittiya. (End of rule 29.)
