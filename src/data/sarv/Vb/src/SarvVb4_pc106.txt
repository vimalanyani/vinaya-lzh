<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時諸比丘尼，欲共諸比丘等，作是言：「汝等五歲不依止他，我等亦如是。汝等十歲畜弟子，我等亦爾，有何差別？」是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問諸比丘尼：「汝等實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，輕大眾？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「從今聽諸比丘尼受大戒滿六歲不依止他、不滿六歲依止他，十二歲得畜眾。以十利故與比丘尼結戒，從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼，不滿十二歲畜眾者，波逸提。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, the bhikkhunīs wanted to be equal to the bhikkhus. They said: “When you have five years seniority, you don’t depend on another. It’s the same for us. When you have 10 years seniority, you take on students. We’ll also do that. Where’s the difference?” 

Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased. They criticized them with all kinds of reasons, and explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked those bhikkhunīs: “Did you really do this?” They answered: “We really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you slight the bhikkhu sangha?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “From now on, I allow that bhikkhunīs don’t depend on another when they’ve been fully ordained for six years, and that they depend on another when they’ve less than six years seniority. When they’ve 12 years seniority, they may take on students. For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī doesn’t have 12 years seniority and takes on students, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波逸提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼，不滿十二歲畜眾者，波逸提。隨畜，隨得爾所波逸提。(一百六事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī doesn’t have 12 years seniority and takes on students, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she takes on students, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 106.)
