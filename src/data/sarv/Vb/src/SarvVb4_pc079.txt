<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時王園精舍，比丘尼僧房門前有好生草，多有雜人在中集坐，看諸比丘尼出入時形相，輕笑言：「汝看是比丘尼睞眼、是眼爛、是短鼻、是癭、是白、是黑、是好、是醜。」諸比丘尼聞是語心不喜，作是念：「諸人集此中者，皆由生草茂盛好故。若無草者，不於中住。」諸比丘尼集諸屎尿棄著草上，草即臭爛乾死。諸居士呵責言：「諸比丘尼不吉弊女，餘無屏廁耶？於此淨茂草處著大小便。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, in front of the gate of the bhikkhunīs’ building in monastery of the king’s park, there was fresh, nice grass. Many different people gathered and sat down there. When they saw the physical features of the bhikkhunīs coming and going, they made fun of them: “Look, this bhikkhunī squints, that one has sore eyes, this one has a short nose, that one has a goiter, this one is white, that one is black, this one is good-looking, that one is ugly.” When the bhikkhunīs heard these words, their minds weren’t pleased, and they thought: “These people gather here, just because the fresh grass is lush and nice. If there was no grass, they wouldn’t stay here.” The bhikkhunīs gathered excrement and urine, and threw it on the grass. Then the grass stank, rotted, dried up, and died. The householders criticized them: “The bhikkhunīs are inauspicious, inferior women. Don’t they have another secluded toilet? On this place with clean, lush grass, they’ve put excrement and urine.”

<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問是比丘尼：「汝等實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，棄屎尿生草上？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼棄屎尿著生草上，波夜提。」</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked those bhikkhunīs: “Did you really do this?” They answered: “We really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you throw excrement and urine on fresh grass?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī throws excrement and urine on fresh grass, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼棄屎尿生草上，波夜提。隨棄，隨得爾所波夜提。(七十九事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī throws excrement and urine on fresh grass, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she throws, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 79.)
