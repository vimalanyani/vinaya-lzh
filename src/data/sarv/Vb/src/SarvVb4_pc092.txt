<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時迦羅比丘尼，本是外道，共諸比丘尼鬪諍相瞋，自打身啼。是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，共比丘尼鬪諍相瞋，自打身啼？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問迦羅比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責：「云何名比丘尼，共比丘尼鬪諍相瞋，自打身啼？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼，共比丘尼鬪諍相瞋，自打身啼者，波夜提。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, Kālī bhikkhunī, who was formerly a non-Buddhist renunciate, quarreled with the bhikkhunīs, and was angry at them. She beat her body and cried. 

Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you, after you’ve quarreled with the other bhikkhunīs and are angry at them, beat your body and cry?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked Kālī bhikkhunī: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you, after you’ve quarreled with the other bhikkhunīs and are angry at them, beat your body and cry?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī, when she has quarreled with the bhikkhunīs and is angry at them, beats her body and cries, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼，共諸比丘尼鬪諍相瞋，自打身啼，波夜提。若自打身不啼，得突吉羅。隨打身啼，隨得爾所波夜提。(九十二事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī, when she has quarreled with the bhikkhunīs and is angry at them, beats her body and cries, it’s a pācittiya. If she beats her body but doesn’t cry, she incurs a dukkaṭa. Whenever she beats her body and cries, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 92.)
