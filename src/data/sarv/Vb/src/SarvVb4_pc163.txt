<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時修闍陀比丘尼，年少端正，與欝多羅長者兒共相識共事，是比丘尼共行坐起言語說俗事。</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, Sujātā bhikkhunī, who was young and attractive, and Uttara, the householder’s son, were friends and did things together: They walked, sat, got up, and talked together, and they spoke about worldly matters.
<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，共男子行說俗事？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問修闍陀比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責：「云何名比丘尼，與男子共行說俗事？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼與男子共行說俗事，波夜提。」</lzh>

Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you walk with a man and speak about worldly matters?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked Sujātā bhikkhunī: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you walk with a man and speak about worldly matters?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī walks with a man and speaks about worldly matters, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼與男子共行說俗事，波夜提。隨共行說俗事，隨得爾所波夜提。(一百六十三事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī walks with a man and speaks about worldly matters, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she walks and speaks about worldly matters, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 163.)
