<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在王舍城，與多比丘僧王舍城安居。舍利弗、目連、阿那律、難提、金毘羅等，是諸大弟子皆共佛安居。爾時諸比丘尼，夏中遊行到他國土，行時殺諸生草小蟲。諸居士瞋呵責言：「佛與大眾舍利弗、目連、阿那律、難提、金毘羅等，王舍城安居。是諸比丘尼自言：『善好有功德。』夏中遊行諸國，殺諸生草小蟲。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Rājagaha. He spent the rains retreat in Rājagaha with a sangha of many bhikkhus: Sāriputta, Moggallāna, Anuruddha, Nandiya, Kimbila, etc. These great disciples all spent the rains retreat together with the Buddha. At that time, the bhikkhunīs wandered to other countries during summer<note> I.e. during the rainy season.</note>. When they walked, they killed the fresh grass and small insects. The householders angrily criticized them: “The Buddha and a great assembly with Sāriputta, Moggallāna, Anuruddha, Nandiya, Kimbila, etc. spend the rains retreat in Rājagaha. These bhikkhunīs say of themselves: ‘We’re virtuous and have merit’, but they wander to these countries during summer and kill the fresh grass and small insects.”

<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，夏中遊行諸國，殺諸生草小蟲？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問諸比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，夏中遊行諸國，殺諸生草小蟲？」佛以種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼夏中無因緣遊行他國，波夜提。」</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you wander to other countries during summer, and kill the fresh grass and small insects?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked the bhikkhunīs: “Did you really do this?” They answered: “We really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you wander to other countries during summer, and kill the fresh grass and small insects?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, the Buddha said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī wanders to another country during summer without a reason, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼夏中無因緣遊行他國，波夜提。隨遊行，隨得爾所波夜提。(九十五事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī wanders to another country during summer without a reason, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she wanders, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 95.)
