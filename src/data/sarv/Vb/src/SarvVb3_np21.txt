<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在王舍城。爾時助調達比丘尼是舊，有善比丘尼是客。是中僧得布施衣，現前僧應分。客比丘尼言：「此非夏末月，是住處不受迦絺那衣，是衣應現前僧分。」助調達比丘尼言：「雖非夏末月不受迦絺那衣，然此是時衣，此安居僧應分。」爾時助調達比丘尼，非時衣作時衣分。</lzh>
The Buddha was in Rājagaha. At that time, the bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta were old residents, and virtuous bhikkhunīs were guests. This sangha received a gift of robe cloth, to be distributed among the sangha that was present. The guest bhikkhunīs said: “This isn’t the last month of the summer (i.e. the rainy season), and this residence hasn’t received the kaṭhina robe. This cloth should be distributed among the sangha that’s present.” The bhikkhunī supporting Devadatta said: “Even though it’s not the last month of the summer, and we haven’t received a kaṭhina robe, this is in-season cloth. It should be distributed among the sangha who spent the rainy season here.” Then the bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta turned out-of-season cloth into in-season cloth and distributed it.

<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，非時衣作時衣分？」種種因緣呵責已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問助調達比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責：「云何名比丘尼，非時衣作時衣分？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼非時衣作時衣分，尼薩耆波逸提。」</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you turn out-of-season cloth into in-season cloth and distribute it?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked the bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta: “Did you really do this?” They answered: “We really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you turn out-of-season cloth into in-season cloth and distribute it?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī turns out-of-season cloth into in-season cloth and distributes it, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>尼薩耆波逸提者，是衣應捨，波逸提罪應悔過。</lzh>
“A nissaggiya pācittiya” means that this cloth should be relinquished, and the pācittiya offense should be confessed.

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼，非時衣作時衣分，尼薩耆波逸提。隨分時，隨得爾所尼薩耆波逸提。(第二十一事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī turns out-of-season cloth into in-season cloth and distributes it, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. Whenever she distributes it, she incurs a nissaggiya pācittiya. (End of rule 21.)
