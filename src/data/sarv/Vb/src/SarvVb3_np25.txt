<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時有比丘尼名施越，多知多識，能多得酥、油、蜜、石蜜。有一估客，見是比丘尼即請言：「若汝所須酥、油、蜜、石蜜者，到我舍取。」比丘尼即受請。有一時施越比丘尼到估客舍，作是言：「我須酥。」即與酥。便言：「我不須酥，當與我油。」復與油。又言：「我須蜜。」復與蜜。又言：「我須石蜜。」復與石蜜。又言：「我不用石蜜，還與我酥。」估客言：「善女！汝欲覓我何等過？適與是，便言：『不須。』更與餘者，又言：『不須。』汝謂我獨施汝耶？多人待我，以汝故妨爾所人。」諸居士聞是事，呵責言：「諸比丘尼自言：『善好有功德。』乞是適與，便言：『不須。』如王夫人、大臣婦。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, there was a bhikkhunī called Gifts-Exceeding(-Grains-of-Sand)<note> Her full name is given in np22 and other rules.</note>, who had much understanding and knowledge, and was able to obtain much ghee, oil, honey, and sugar. There was a merchant who saw this bhikkhunī and invited her: “If you need any ghee, oil, honey, or sugar, come to my house and take it.” The bhikkhunī accepted the invitation. One time, Gifts-Exceeding(-Grains-of-Sand) bhikkhunī went to the merchant’s house and said: “I need ghee.” Then they gave ghee. Then she said: “I don’t need ghee, you should give me oil.” They gave oil again. She said further: “I need honey.” They gave honey again. She said further: “I need sugar.” They gave sugar again. She said further: “I’ve no use for sugar, return the ghee to me.” The merchant said: “Good woman, are you trying to see what shortcomings I have? I’ve just given one thing, and you said: ‘I don’t need it.’ Then you asked for something else, and said again: ‘I don’t need it.’ Do you think I only give to you? Many people are waiting for me, but because of you, so many people are inconvenienced.” When the householders heard about this matter, they criticized her: “These bhikkhunīs say of themselves: ‘We’re virtuous and have merit’, but they ask for one thing, and when someone has just given it, they say: ‘We don’t need it’, like queens and wives of high officials.”

<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，乞是適與，便言：『我不須。』更索餘物？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問施越比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，乞是與是，便言：『不須。』更索餘物？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼乞是已更索餘者，尼薩耆波夜提。」</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you ask for one thing, and when someone has just given it, you say: ‘I don’t need it’, and ask for something else?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked Gifts-Exceeding(-Grains-of-Sand) bhikkhunī: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you ask for one thing, and someone gives it, and then you say: ‘I don’t need it’, and ask for something else?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī having asked for one thing then asks for something else, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>尼薩耆波夜提者，是物應捨，波夜提罪應悔過。</lzh>
“A nissaggiya pācittiya” means that this item should be relinquished, and the pācittiya offense should be confessed.

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼乞酥適與酥，便言：「不須酥，我須油、蜜、石蜜。」尼薩耆波夜提。若乞油與油，便言：「我不須油，與我蜜、石蜜、酥。」尼薩耆波夜提。若比丘尼，乞蜜與蜜，便言：「我不須蜜，與我石蜜、酥、油。」尼薩耆波夜提。若比丘尼，乞石蜜與石蜜，便言：「我不須石蜜，與我酥、油、蜜。」尼薩耆波夜提。所乞者未受，更取餘者，尼薩耆波夜提。(第二十五事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī asks for ghee, and when they’ve just given ghee, she says: “I don’t need ghee, I need oil, honey, or sugar,” it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. If she asks for oil, and they give oil, and she then says: “I don’t need oil, give me honey, sugar, or ghee,” it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. If a bhikkhunī asks for honey, and they give honey, and she then says: “I don’t need honey, give me sugar, ghee, or oil,” it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. If a bhikkhunī asks for sugar, and they give sugar, and she then says: “I don’t need sugar, give me ghee, oil, or honey,” it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. Whenever she asks, doesn’t accept, and still takes something else, she incurs a nissaggiya pācittiya. (End of rule 25.)
