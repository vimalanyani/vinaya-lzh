<lzh>十七僧殘中不共戒有十之初(此初一事即十七中第四)</lzh>
First of the 10 unshared precepts among the 17 saṅghādisesas. (This first rule is actually the fourth of the 17.)


<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時有比丘尼，名施越，年少端正。有一估客，見已生漏心，作是念：「諸比丘尼王所守護，不得強為不淨事，我當請供養所須。」作是念已，便到是比丘尼所言：「汝所須物，若飲食、衣服、臥具、湯藥所須，我當相給。」比丘尼言：「當受汝請。」是比丘尼後時，所須飲食、衣服、臥具、湯藥、薪草、燈燭，皆從索取。估客知比丘尼心轉柔軟，便語比丘尼言：「作婬事來。」比丘尼言：「莫作是語，我是持戒斷婬欲人。」估客瞋言：「小婢！汝若持戒斷婬欲者，何故受我衣食供養？」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, there was a bhikkhunī called Gifts-Exceeding(-Grains-of-Sand)<note> Her full name is given in np22 and other rules.</note>, who was young and attractive. When a merchant saw her, defilements arose in his mind, and he thought: “The bhikkhunīs are protected by the king, and it’s not allowed to rape them. I’ll invite her and support her with what she needs.” Having thought that, he went to the bhikkhunī and said: “Whatever things you need, whether food and drinks, robes, bedding, or medicines, I’ll provide for you.” The bhikkhunī said: “I accept your invitation.” Later when that bhikkhunī needed food and drinks, robes, bedding, medicines, firewood, grass, lamps, and candles, she asked and took everything from him. When the merchant knew that the bhikkhunī’s mind had become soft, he said to her: “Come and engage in sexual intercourse.” The bhikkhunī said: “Don’t speak like this. I’m a person who keeps precepts and has abandoned sexual desire.” The merchant said angrily: “You little slavewoman! If you keep precepts and have abandoned sexual desire, why did you accept my offerings of robes and food?”
<lzh>即便強捉比丘尼，比丘尼高聲大喚。即時多人來集問言：「何故大喚？」估客言：「是比丘尼受我衣食，不隨我意。」諸居士語比丘尼：「汝受他物，何故不隨他意？」比丘尼言：「我不為婬欲故受彼財物，是估客自來請我作是言：『汝所須衣食、湯藥、薪草、燈燭自恣相給。』我不知以何心故與我？」諸居士言：「是估客為是汝父親里母親里耶？」比丘尼言：「不是。」諸居士言：「若非汝父母親，又非賢者不求福德，何故不知與汝財物？與汝財衣時必為婬欲事。」諸居士呵責言：「云何諸比丘尼自言：『善好有功德。』如婬女法取他財物？」</lzh>
Then he grabbed the bhikkhunī by force, and the bhikkhunī screamed loudly. Then many people came, gathered, and asked: “Why did you scream?” The merchant said: “This bhikkhunī accepted my robes and food, but she doesn’t submit to my will.” The householders said to the bhikkhunī: “You accepted his things, why don’t you submit to his will?” The bhikkhunī said: “I didn’t accept his requisites out of sexual desire. This merchant came on his own and invited me by saying: ‘I invite you and will provide what you need, whether robes, food, medicines, firewood, grass, lamps, or candles.’ I didn’t know with what intention he gave to me.” The householders said: “Is this merchant one of your paternal or maternal relatives?” The bhikkhunī said: “No.” The householders said: “Since he’s not a paternal or maternal relative, and also an unvirtuous person who isn’t seeking merit, how could you not know why he gave you requisites? When he gave you requisites and robes, it must have been out of sexual desire.” The householders criticized her: “How can these bhikkhunīs say of themselves: ‘We’re virtuous and have merit’, when they take others’ requisites like prostitutes?”
<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問施越比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼有漏心，從漏心男子自手取食？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒，從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼有漏心，從漏心男子自手取食，是法初犯僧伽婆尸沙可悔過。」</lzh>

Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked Gifts-Exceeding(-Grains-of-Sand) bhikkhunī: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you, with a defiled mind, took food with your own hand from a man with a defiled mind?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī, with a defiled mind, takes food with her own hand from a man with a defiled mind, that act is an immediate saṅghādisesa, from which one can repent.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>漏心者，於是人邊愛結深厚，男子漏心亦如是。</lzh>
“A defiled mind” means, when she’s close to that person, the fetter of desire is strong. Likewise for “a man with a defiled mind”.

<lzh>男子者，謂人男，能作婬事。</lzh>
“A man” means a human man who can engage in sexual intercourse.

<lzh>食者，五佉陀尼、五蒲闍尼、五似食。五佉陀尼者，根食、莖食、葉食、華食、果食。五蒲闍尼者，飯、麨、糒、魚、肉。五似食者，糜、粟、䵃麥、莠子、加師食。</lzh>
“Food” means the five staple foods, the five non-staple foods, and the five things resembling food. “The five staple foods” means food from roots, stalks, leaves, flowers, and fruits. “The five non-staple foods” means cooked rice, flour, dried cooked rice cakes, fish, and meat. “The five things resembling food” means rice gruel, millet, barley, tares, and bitter drinks<note> A transliteration of kasaṭa, kasāva, or kasāya?</note>. 

<lzh>僧伽婆尸沙者，是罪屬僧，僧中有殘，因僧前悔過得除滅，故名僧伽婆尸沙。</lzh>
“A saṅghādisesa” means this offense is dependent upon the sangha, and in the sangha there’s a remainder. Because she confesses and is able to clear it in front of the sangha, therefore it’s called a saṅghādisesa. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼有漏心，自手從漏心男子手取根食，得僧伽婆尸沙。若取莖、葉、華、果、飯、麨、糒、魚、肉、糜、粟、䵃麥、莠子、加師食，皆僧伽婆尸沙。若有居士，因是比丘尼故，與比丘尼僧作食，偏與所愛比丘尼多食。比丘尼受者，偷蘭遮。(第四戒竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī, with a defiled mind, takes edible roots with her own hand from the hand of a man with a defiled mind, she incurs a saṅghādisesa. If she takes stalks, leaves, flowers, fruits, cooked rice, flour, dried cooked rice, fish, meat, rice gruel, millet, barley, tares, or bitter drinks, all are saṅghādisesas. If there’s a householder, who because of this bhikkhunī, prepares food for the bhikkhunī sangha, and gives much food especially to the bhikkhunī he’s in love with, and if the bhikkhunī accepts it, it’s a thullaccaya.
