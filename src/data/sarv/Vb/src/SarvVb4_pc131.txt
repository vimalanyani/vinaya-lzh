<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在王舍城。爾時助調達比丘尼，多畜衣，不分別何者是所受僧伽梨？何者是所受欝多羅僧？何者是所受安陀會？何者是所受覆肩衣？何者所受俱修羅？諸比丘尼問助調達比丘尼：「何者是汝所受僧伽梨、欝多羅僧、安陀會、覆肩衣、俱修羅？」答言：「小住！我問和上尼、問阿闍梨尼、問共活尼。」即往問言：「何者我所受僧伽梨、欝多羅僧、安陀會、覆肩衣、俱修羅？」諸人答言：「我不知不憶，疑何者是汝所受、非所受？」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Rājagaha. At that time, the bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta kept many robes, but they didn’t separate them according to who had determined which saṅghāṭī, upper robe, lower robe, shoulder-covering robe, and kusūla<note> A kind of skirt.</note>. The bhikkhunīs asked the bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta: “Which ones are your determined saṅghāṭīs, upper robes, lower robes, shoulder-covering robes, and kusūlas?” They answered: “Wait a moment. We’ll ask our preceptors, teachers, and the bhikkhunīs living with us.” Then they went and asked: “Which ones are our determined saṅghāṭīs, upper robes, lower robes, shoulder-covering robes, and kusūlas?” Those people answered: “We don’t know and don’t remember. We’re unsure whether they’ve been determined by you or not.”
<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，多畜衣，不知何者是所受僧伽梨、欝多羅僧、安陀會、覆肩衣、俱修羅？」種種因緣呵責已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問助調達比丘尼言：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責：「云何名比丘尼，多畜衣，不知何者是所受僧伽梨、欝多羅僧、安陀會、覆肩衣、俱修羅？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「從今比丘尼五夜應看五衣。以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼五夜不看五衣，波逸提。」</lzh>

Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you keep many robes, and don’t know who has determined which saṅghāṭī, upper robe, lower robe, shoulder-covering robe, and kusūla?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked the bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta: “Did you really do this?” They answered: “We really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you keep many robes, and don’t know who has determined which saṅghāṭī, upper robe, lower robe, shoulder-covering robe, and kusūla?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “From now on, the bhikkhunīs should look after their five robes every five days. For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī doesn’t look after her five robes every five days, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波逸提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼五夜不看五衣，波逸提。隨不看，隨得波逸提。(一百三十一事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī doesn’t look after her five robes every five days, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she doesn’t look after them, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 131.)
