<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時偷蘭難陀比丘尼，滿十二歲欲畜眾，語諸比丘尼：「我受大戒滿十二歲，今欲畜眾，當作何等？」諸比丘尼以是事白佛，佛言：「汝等當為偷蘭難陀比丘尼作畜眾羯磨。若更有如是比丘尼，亦應與作畜眾羯磨。畜眾羯磨法者，一心和合比丘尼僧，偷蘭難陀比丘尼應從坐起，偏袒右肩、脫革屣、胡跪合掌，作如是言：『大德尼僧聽！我偷蘭難陀比丘尼，受大戒滿十二歲，欲畜眾。我今從僧乞畜眾羯磨，僧為我偷蘭難陀比丘尼作畜眾羯磨，僧憐愍故。』第二、第三亦如是乞。</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, Thullanandā bhikkhunī had 12 years seniority and wanted to take on students. She said to the bhikkhunīs: “I’ve been fully ordained for 12 years, now I want to take on students. What should I do?” 
The bhikkhunīs told the Buddha about this matter and the Buddha said: “You should carry out a formal act to take on students for Thullanandā bhikkhunī. If there are also other such bhikkhunīs, you should also carry out a formal act to take on students for them. 


<h2>Saṅghakamma</h2>

‘A formal act to take on students’ means in a unanimous, harmonious bhikkhunī sangha, Thullanandā bhikkhunī should get up from her seat, uncover her right shoulder, remove her shoes, kneel down, join her palms, and say: ‘Venerable bhikkhunīs, may the sangha listen. I, Thullanandā bhikkhunī, have been fully ordained for 12 years and want to take on students. I now ask the sangha for the formal act to take on students. May the sangha carry out the formal act to take on students for me, Thullanandā bhikkhunī, out of the sangha’s compassion.’ She asks like this a second and third time.
<lzh>爾時一比丘尼應僧中唱言：『大德尼僧聽！是偷蘭難陀比丘尼，受大戒滿十二歲，欲畜眾。是偷蘭難陀比丘尼，從僧乞畜眾羯磨。若僧時到僧忍聽，僧今與偷蘭難陀比丘尼作畜眾羯磨。是名白。』如是白四羯磨。『僧與偷蘭難陀比丘尼作畜眾羯磨竟，僧忍，默然故，是事如是持！』以十利故與比丘尼結戒，從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼滿十二歲，未作畜眾羯磨，畜眾者，波逸提。」</lzh>
Then one bhikkhunī should announce in the sangha: ‘Venerable bhikkhunīs, may the sangha listen. This Thullanandā bhikkhunī has been fully ordained for 12 years and wants to take on students. This Thullanandā bhikkhunī asks the sangha for the formal act to take on students. If the right time has come for the sangha, may the sangha approve that the sangha now carries out the formal act to take on students for Thullanandā bhikkhunī. This is called the motion.’ In this way, (they do) a formal act with a motion as fourth. ‘The sangha has carried out a formal act to take on students for Thullanandā bhikkhunī. The sangha accepts this, therefore you’re silent. This matter is remembered thus.’ 


<h2>Origin Story (continued)</h2>

For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī has 12 years seniority and takes on students when the formal act to take on students hasn’t been carried out yet, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波逸提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼滿十二歲，未作畜眾羯磨，畜眾者，波逸提。隨畜，隨得爾所波逸提。(一百七事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī has 12 years seniority and takes on students when the formal act to take on students hasn’t been carried out yet, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she takes one on, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 107.)
