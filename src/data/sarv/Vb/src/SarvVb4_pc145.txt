<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時舍衛國節日，諸居士辦種種好飲食，欲出城詣園林中。諸白衣婦洗浴以香塗身莊嚴頭面，治目塗髮，著新好衣，內外莊嚴具。助調達比丘尼入是家，見居士婦問言：「汝洗浴以香塗身，莊嚴頭面，治目塗髮，著新好衣，內外莊嚴具，欲作何等？」答言：「欲詣園林中遊戲。」語比丘尼言：「善女！汝能去不？」答言：「能去。」問言：「汝欲乘乘、為當步去？」比丘尼言：「我等為是婢供養汝耶？云何當步？」居士婦言：「汝能上乘不？」比丘尼言：「汝等尚能，我何以不能？」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, there was a holiday in Sāvatthī. The householders prepared all kinds of good food and drinks and wanted to leave the city to go to a park grove. The lay women bathed, applied perfume on their bodies, adorned their heads and faces, applied makeup on their eyes, smoothened their hair, put on new, beautiful clothes and inner and outer ornaments. Bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta entered that house, and when they saw the ladies of the house, they asked: “You’ve bathed, applied perfume on your bodies, adorned your heads and faces, applied makeup on your eyes, smoothened your hair, and put on new, beautiful clothes and inner and outer ornaments. What do you want to do?” They answered: “We want to go to a park grove on an outing.” And they asked the bhikkhunīs: “Good women, can you come?” They answered: “We can come.” They asked: “Do you want to ride in a vehicle, or will you go on foot?” The bhikkhunīs said: “Are we slaves serving you? Why would we go on foot?” The ladies of the house said: “Can you get into a vehicle?” The bhikkhunīs said: “You can also do that, why wouldn’t we?” 

<lzh>是中有婦女羞夫婿、羞夫婿父母者，便閉車前後。有無婿及父母者，開車而去。諸比丘尼無所畏故，開車大語戲，共相隨去。諸居士呵責言：「諸比丘尼自言：『善好有功德。』乘車行，如王夫人、大臣婦。」是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問助調達比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責：「云何名比丘尼，乘乘？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼無病乘乘，波夜提。」</lzh>
Among the women were those who were felt shy in front of their husbands and their husband’s parents, and they closed the chariots in front and in the back. There were also some without a husband and parents, who went with the chariots open. Because the bhikkhunīs were fearless, they opened the chariot, and talking and laughing loudly, went following the others. The householders criticized them: “These bhikkhunīs say of themselves: ‘We’re virtuous and have merit’, but they go around riding in chariots, like queens and wives of high officials.” 
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked the bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta: “Did you really do this?” They answered: “We really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you ride in a vehicle?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī, who isn’t sick, rides in a vehicle, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼無病乘乘，波夜提。隨無病乘乘，隨得波夜提。若病，不犯。(一百四十五事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī, who isn’t sick, rides in a vehicle, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she, not being sick, rides in a vehicle, she incurs a pācittiya. If she’s sick, the offense isn’t committed. (End of rule 145.)
