<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在王舍城。爾時有比丘尼，往語施越比丘尼言：「若汝無漏心，男子有漏心，但從自手取食噉、若隨意用，於汝何所能？」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Rājagaha.<note> Should be Sāvatthī, as this rule follows on from the previous rule.</note> At that time, there was a bhikkhunī who went to Gifts-Exceeding(-Grains-of-Sand) bhikkhunī and said: “If you don’t have a defiled mind, but the man has a defiled mind, just take food from him with your own hand and eat it. If you use it as you want, what can that do to you?”

<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，語他比丘尼言：『汝無漏心，男子有漏心，但從自手取食噉、若隨意用，於汝何所能？』」種種因緣呵責已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問是比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責是比丘尼言：「云何名比丘尼，勸他比丘尼言：『汝無漏心，從漏心男子自手取食噉、若隨意用，於汝何所能？』」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼言：『若汝無漏心，從漏心男子自手取食噉、若隨意用，於汝何所能？』是法初犯僧伽婆尸沙可悔過。」</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you say to another bhikkhunī: ‘If you don’t have a defiled mind, but the man has a defiled mind, just take food from him with your own hand and eat it. If you use it as you want, what can that do to you?’” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked that bhikkhunī: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you exhort another bhikkhunī: ‘If you don’t have a defiled mind, but the man has a defiled mind, just take food from him with your own hand and eat it. If you use it as you want, what can that do to you?’” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī says: “If you don’t have a defiled mind, take food with your own hand from a man with a defiled mind and eat it. If you use it as you want, what can that do to you?”, that act is an immediate saṅghādisesa, from which one can repent.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>僧伽婆尸沙者，是罪屬僧，僧中有殘，因僧前悔過除滅，是名僧伽婆尸沙。</lzh>
“A saṅghādisesa” means this offense is dependent upon the sangha, and in the sangha there’s a remainder. Because she confesses and clears it in front of the sangha, therefore it’s called a saṅghādisesa. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼語比丘尼言：「汝有漏心，從漏心男子自手取食噉、若隨意用，於汝何所能？」僧伽婆尸沙。若比丘尼語比丘尼言：「若汝無漏心，漏心男子與汝食，但取噉隨意用，於汝何所能？」僧伽婆尸沙。若比丘尼語比丘尼言：「若汝有漏心，漏心男子於汝何所能？汝莫從彼自手取食噉、莫隨意用。」偷蘭遮。若比丘尼語比丘尼言：「若汝無漏心，男子有漏心，於汝何所能？但莫自手取食噉、莫隨意用，偷蘭遮。」(第五事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī says to another bhikkhunī: “If you don’t have a defiled mind, take food with your own hand from a man with a defiled mind and eat it. If you use it as you want, what can that do to you?”, it’s a saṅghādisesa. If a bhikkhunī says to another bhikkhunī: “If you don’t have a defiled mind, and a man with a defiled mind gives you food, just take it and eat it. If you use it as you want, what can that do to you?”, it’s a saṅghādisesa. If a bhikkhunī says to another bhikkhunī: “If you have a defiled mind, and a man has a defiled mind, what can that do to you? Don’t take food from him with your own hand and eat it. Don’t use it as you want,” it’s a thullaccaya. If a bhikkhunī says to another bhikkhunī: “If you don’t have a defiled mind, and a man has a defiled mind, what can that do to you? Don’t take food from him with your own hand and eat it. Don’t use it as you want,” it’s a thullaccaya. (End of rule 5.)
