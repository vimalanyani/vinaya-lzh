<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時偷蘭難陀比丘尼，有弟子名施越沙，善好樂持戒但喜忘。施越沙摘故衣，不自縫、不使人縫，所摘衣散在異處。是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，呵責：「云何名比丘尼，摘故衣不自縫、不使人縫，散在異處？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問施越沙比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責：「云何名比丘尼，摘故衣不自縫、不使人縫，散在異處？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「從今聽諸比丘尼作衣極久五夜，應還受。以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼作衣，極久乃至五夜。過是成者，波逸提。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, Thullanandā bhikkhunī had a studend called Gifts-Exceeding-Grains-of-Sand who was virtuous and willing to keep the precepts, but was forgetful. Gifts-Exceeding-Grains-of-Sand unsewed her old robe but she neither sewed it back together herself, nor had others sew it, and (the pieces of) her unsewed robe were scattered in various places.

Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized her: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you unsew your old robe, and then neither sew it back together yourself, nor have others sew it, so that it’s scattered in various places?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked Gifts-Exceeding-Grains-of-Sand bhikkhunī: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you unsew your old robe, and then neither sew it back together yourself, nor have others sew it, so that it’s scattered in various places?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “From now on, I allow the bhikkhunīs to make a robe within five days at most, and it should be determined again. For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If bhikkhunī makes a robe, it should be done within five days at most. If she takes longer to complete it, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波逸提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼作衣時過五夜，波逸提。隨過，隨得波逸提。(一百三十事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī takes longer than five days to make a robe, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she takes longer, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 130.)
