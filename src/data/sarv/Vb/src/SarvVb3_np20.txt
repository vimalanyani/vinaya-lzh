<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時有善比丘尼是舊，助調達比丘尼是客，是住處得布施衣，安居僧應分。舊比丘尼言：「是夏末後月，是住處受迦絺那衣，此是時衣，安居僧應分。」助調達比丘尼言：「汝等不善知，雖夏末月受迦絺那衣，此是非時衣，現前僧應分。」爾時助調達比丘尼，時衣作非時衣分。</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, there were virtuous bhikkhunīs who were old residents, and the bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta were guests. This residence received a gift of robe cloth, to be distributed among the sangha that spent the rains retreat there. The old bhikkhunīs said: “This is the last month of the summer (i.e. the rainy season), and this residence has received the kaṭhina robe. This is in-season cloth and should be distributed among the sangha that has spent the rains retreat here.” The bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta said: “You’re not well-learned. Even though it’s the last month of the summer, and you’ve received a kaṭhina robe, this is out-of-season cloth. It should be distributed among the sangha who is present.” Then the bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta turned in-season cloth into out-of-season cloth and distributed it.

<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，時衣作非時衣分？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問助調達比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，時衣作非時衣分？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼時衣作非時衣分，尼薩耆波逸提。」</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you turn in-season cloth into out-of-season cloth and distribute it?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked the bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta: “Did you really do this?” They answered: “We really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you turn in-season cloth into out-of-season cloth and distribute it?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī turns in-season cloth into out-of-season cloth and distributes it, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>尼薩耆波逸提者，是衣應捨，波逸提罪應悔過。</lzh>
“A nissaggiya pācittiya” means that this cloth should be relinquished, and the pācittiya offense should be confessed.

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼時衣作非時衣分者，隨分時隨得爾所尼薩耆波逸提。(第二十事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī turns in-season cloth into out-of-season cloth and distributes it, then whenever she distributes it, she incurs a nissaggiya pācittiya. (End of rule 20.)
