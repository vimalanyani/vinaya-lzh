<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時偷蘭難陀比丘尼，著頭光在婬女門中立。諸婆羅門居士來欲近之，即以脚蹴蹋，作是言：「汝欲共我作婬欲耶？」諸居士呵責言：「諸比丘尼自言：『善好有功德。』著頭光在婬女門中立，見諸人來近以脚蹴蹋。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, Thullanandā bhikkhunī wore a head ornament and stood in the door of prostitutes. The brahmin householders came and wanted to get close. Then she kicked them with her foot and said: “Did you want to have sex with me?” The householders criticized her: “These bhikkhunīs say of themselves: ‘We’re virtuous and have merit’, but they put on head ornaments and stand in the door of prostitutes. When they see people coming close, they kick them with their feet.”

<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問偷蘭難陀比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，著頭光在婬女門中立？」種種呵已語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼著頭光，波夜提。」</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked Thullanandā bhikkhunī: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you wear a head ornament and stand in the door of prostitutes?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī wears a head ornament, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼著頭光，波夜提。若作，突吉羅。若治故光，突吉羅。若與他著，突吉羅。(一百六十六事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī wears a head ornament, it’s a pācittiya. If she makes one, it’s a dukkaṭa. If she repairs an old ornament, it’s a dukkaṭa. If she gives it to others to wear, it’s a dukkaṭa. (End of rule 166.)
