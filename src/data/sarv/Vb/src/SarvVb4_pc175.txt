<h2>First Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時偷蘭難陀比丘尼，故出精。</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, Thullanandā bhikkhunī intentionally emitted sexual fluid.

<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，故出精？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問偷蘭難陀比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，故出精？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼故出精，波夜提。」</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you intentionally emit sexual fluid?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked Thullanandā bhikkhunī: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you intentionally emit sexual fluid?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Preliminary Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī intentionally emits sexual fluid, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼故出精，波夜提。隨故出精，隨得爾所波夜提。</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī intentionally emits sexual fluid, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she intentionally emits sexual fluid, she incurs a pācittiya.


<h2>Second Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時諸比丘尼夢中失精，覺已作是念：「佛結戒，不聽我等故出精。今夢中失精，我當云何？」是事白佛。佛以是事集二部僧，種種因緣讚戒、讚持戒，讚戒、讚持戒已，語諸比丘：「從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼故出精，除夢中，波夜提。」(一百七十五事竟)</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, the bhikkhunīs lost sexual fluid during a dream. Upon waking up, they thought: “The Buddha has laid down a precept that we’re not allowed to intentionally emit sexual fluid. Now we’ve lost sexual fluid during a dream. What should we do?” They spoke with the Buddha about this matter and he therefore gathered both sanghas. In all kinds of ways, he praised the precepts and praised keeping precepts. Having praised the precepts and praised keeping precepts, he said to the bhikkhus: “From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī intentionally emits sexual fluid, except during a dream, it’s a pācittiya.’”
