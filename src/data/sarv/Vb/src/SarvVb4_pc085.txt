<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時偷蘭難陀比丘尼，以樹膠作男根，繫著脚跟，後著女根中。爾時失火，燒比丘尼房舍。偷蘭難陀比丘尼，忘不解却走出房外，語諸居士言：「是中失火，以水澆滅。」有一估客，見偷蘭難陀有如是事，語餘人言：「汝等看是比丘尼，有如是好莊嚴具。」是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，作男根著女根中？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼作男根著女根中，波夜提。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, Thullanandā bhikkhunī made a dildo out of gum and bound it to her heel. Later she put it into her vagina. Then a fire broke out and burnt the bhikkhunīs’ building. Thullanandā bhikkhunī forgot about it, and left the building without untying it. She said to the householders: “A fire has broken out here, douse it with water.” There was a merchant who saw that Thullanandā had such a thing, and said to the other people: “Look, this bhikkhunī has such a beautiful ornament.” 

Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased. Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked her: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you make a dildo and put it into your vagina?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī makes a dildo and puts it into her vagina, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼，以樹膠作男根著女根中，波夜提。若韋囊、若脚指、若肉臠、若藕根、若蘿蔔根、若蕪菁根、若瓜、若瓠、若梨，著女根中，皆波夜提。作時，突吉羅。若著他比丘尼女根中，突吉羅。(八十五事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī makes a dildo out of gum and puts it into her vagina, it’s a pācittiya. If she puts a leather bag, her toe, a lump of meat, a lotus root, a radish root, a turnip root, a melon, a bottle-gourd, or a pear into her vagina, all are pācittiyas. When she makes it, it’s a dukkaṭa. If she puts it into another bhikkhunī’s vagina, it’s a dukkaṭa. (End of rule 85.)
