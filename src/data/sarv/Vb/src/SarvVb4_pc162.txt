<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時偷蘭難陀比丘尼，兩道中間生癰，即喚白衣解看還繫。</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, Thullanandā bhikkhunī developed an abscess between the anus and the vagina. Then she called a lay person to untie (the bandage), look, and bandage it again.
<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，屏處有瘡，令白衣解看還繫？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問偷蘭難陀比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，屏處有瘡，使白衣解看還繫？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼有瘡，使白衣解繫者，波夜提。」</lzh>

Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you, when having an abscess in the hidden place, have a lay person untie (the bandage), look, and bandage it again?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked Thullanandā bhikkhunī: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you, when having an abscess in the hidden place, have a lay person untie (the bandage), look, and bandage it again?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī has an abscess, and has a lay person<note> The pātimokkha says: A man.</note> untie (the bandage), and bandage it, it’s a pācittiya.’”

<lzh>瘡者有三種：一者癰瘡等自生、二者物傷、三者中風堅癖。癖有三種：冷癖、熱癖、風癖。若比丘尼，自能繫不能解，應自繫令他解。若自能解不能繫，應自解令他繫。</lzh>
An “abscess” means there are three kinds: 1) An abscess, a boil, etc. that developed on its own. 2) An injury caused by an item. 3) A hard lump caused by wind. There are three kinds of lumps: a cold lump, a hot lump, and an air(-filled) lump. If a bhikkhunī can bandage it herself, but can’t untie (the bandage), she should bandage it herself and have others untie (the bandage). If she can untie (the bandage) herself but can’t bandage it, she should untie (the bandage) herself and have others bandage it.

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼，令白衣繫而不解，波夜提。若令解不繫，波夜提。隨令繫解，隨得爾所波夜提。(一百六十二事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī has a lay person bandage it, but not untie (the bandage), it’s a pācittiya. If she has them untie (the bandage), but not bandage it, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she has them bandage and untie (the bandage), she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 162.)
