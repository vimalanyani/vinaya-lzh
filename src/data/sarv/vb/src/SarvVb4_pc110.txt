<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時偷蘭難陀比丘尼，畜眾不教誡、不為說法。弟子白言：「和上尼！何以不教化我、不為我說法？」答言：「我不教化汝、不為汝說法。」弟子以是事向諸比丘尼說，諸比丘尼以是事向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問偷蘭難陀比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，畜眾不教化、不為說法？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘尼：「汝等為偷蘭難陀作止羯磨。若更有如是者，亦應與作止羯磨。</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, Thullanandā bhikkhunī took on a student and didn’t instruct her, and didn’t teach her the dhamma. The student said: “Preceptor, why don’t you guide me, and don’t teach me the dhamma?” She answered: “I don’t guide you, and don’t teach you the dhamma.” 

The student told the bhikkhunīs about this matter, and they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked Thullanandā bhikkhunī: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you take on a student and don’t guide her and don’t teach her the dhamma?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhunīs: “You should carry out a formal act to stop Thullanandā bhikkhunī. If there are also others doing this, you should also carry out a formal act to stop them. 


<h2>Saṅghakamma</h2>

<lzh>作止羯磨法者，一心和合僧，一比丘尼僧中唱言：『大德尼僧聽！偷蘭難陀比丘尼，畜弟子不教化、不為說法。若僧時到僧忍聽，僧與偷蘭難陀作止羯磨：「汝偷蘭難陀，莫復畜眾。」是名白。』如是白二羯磨。『僧與偷蘭難陀作止畜眾羯磨竟，僧忍，默然故，是事如是持！』以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼僧與作止羯磨，畜眾者，波逸提。」</lzh>
‘A formal act to stop her’ means in a unanimous, harmonious sangha, one bhikkhunī should announce in the sangha: ‘Venerable bhikkhunīs, may the sangha listen. Thullanandā bhikkhunī took on a student and doesn’t guide her and doesn’t teach her the dhamma. If the right time has come for the sangha, may the sangha approve that the sangha carries out the formal act to stop Thullanandā bhikkhunī: “Thullanandā, don’t take on students anymore.” This is called the motion.’ In this way, (they do) a formal act with a motion as second. ‘The sangha has carried out a formal act to stop Thullanandā bhikkhunī from taking on students. The sangha accepts this, therefore you’re silent. This matter is remembered thus.’ 


<h2>Origin Story (continued)</h2>

For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī takes on students when the sangha has carried out a formal act to stop her, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波逸提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼僧與作止羯磨，畜眾者，波逸提。隨畜眾，隨得爾所波逸提。(一百一十事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī takes on students when the sangha has carried out a formal act to stop her, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she takes on students, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 110.)
