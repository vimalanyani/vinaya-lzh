<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時諸比丘尼欲遊行他國，白王言：「我等欲遊行他國，王當為我約勅諸國，莫令人民遮道惱我。」王即遣使約勅四方：「莫惱諸比丘尼，供給所須飲食燈燭。」諸比丘尼遊行次，到無僧坊聚落，至一居士家欲宿，謂居士言：「汝出舍去，我於中宿。」居士言：「善女！我在自舍，教我何去？」比丘尼重言：「汝但出去，汝欲惱我欺我耶？汝若不去者，我有官力，令汝得惱。」居士作是思惟：「諸比丘尼為王所護，有官力勢，或當惱我？」作是念已怖畏即出。是居士老瘦無力，於冬寒時出舍垂死。諸居士呵責言：「云何諸比丘尼自言：『善好有功德。』不問主人便敷臥處，如王夫人、大臣婦。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, the bhikkhunīs wanted to wander to other countries. They informed the king: “We want to wander to other countries. May the king command these countries on our behalf not to let the people obstruct our way and make trouble for us.” Then the king sent messengers to command the four directions: “Don’t make trouble for the bhikkhunīs. Support them with the necessities, food, drinks, lamps and candles.” The bhikkhunīs wandered by stages and came to a village without a monastery. They went to a householder’s house, wanted to stay overnight, and said to the householder: “Leave your house and go away, we’ll spend the night in there.” The householder said: “Good women, I’m in my own house. Where do you tell me to go?” The bhikkhunīs insisted: “Just leave. Do you want to make trouble for us and mistreat us? If you don’t go, we’ve official authority and will make trouble for you.” The householder thought: “These bhikkhunīs are protected by the king and have official authority. Might they make trouble for me?” Having thought this, he fearfully left. This householder was old, weak, and without strength. He left his house in the cold winter time and nearly died. The householders criticized them: “Why do these bhikkhunīs say of themselves: ‘We’re virtuous and have merit’, but they just lay out sleeping places without asking the owner, like queens and wives of high officials.”

<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，不問主人便敷臥具？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼，不問主人便敷臥具、若使人敷，波逸提。」</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked them: “Did you really do this?” They answered: “We really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you just lay out bedding without asking the owner?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī, without asking the owner, just lays out bedding, or has others lay it out, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波逸提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼，不問主人若自敷臥具，波逸提。若使人敷，波逸提。隨不問自敷、使人敷，隨得爾所波逸提。(一百五事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī lays out bedding herself without asking the owner, it’s a pācittiya. If she has others lay it out, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she lays it out herself or has others lay it out, without asking the owner, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 105.)
