<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時舍衛國節日，諸居士辦種種好飲食，出城至園中，但有諸新婦在家。偷蘭難陀比丘尼，與一家知識，早起著衣持鉢入是家。新婦畏婿來、若婿父母來，於中門外與敷坐，共相問訊便坐。諸新婦頭面禮比丘尼足，現前而坐。比丘尼即為說法，經久閉目便唄，新婦恐婿來見、若婿父母來故，即便起去。第二、第三新婦亦復如是。比丘尼開眼，看見前無人在，心生慚愧捨坐處去。</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, there was a holiday in Sāvatthī. The householders prepared all kinds of good food and drinks, and left the city to go to a park, but the newly-wed wives stayed at home. Thullanandā bhikkhunī was acquainted with one house, and she got up early, put on her robes, took her bowl, and entered that house. The newly-wed wives were afraid that their husband would come, or their husband’s parents would come, so they laid out a seat outside the middle gate, greeted her and sat down. The newly-wed wives paid respect with their heads at the bhikkhunī’s feet and sat down in front of her. The bhikkhunī then closed her eyes for a long time to recite the dhamma and the suttas and to chant. Because a newly-wed wife was afraid that her husband would come and see them, or that his parents would come, she got up and left. The second and the third newly-wed wives also did likewise. When the bhikkhunī opened her eyes and saw that nobody was in front of her, embarrassment arose in her mind. She abandoned the seat and left.
<lzh>是家近大巷，有諸蔽惡人，入門見其坐床，四顧無人，便偷持去。諸新婦不聞比丘尼聲，共相謂言：「往看在不？」咸言：「不在。」「坐床在不？」答言：「不在。」作是念：「比丘尼必持至僧坊中。」遣使索言：「還我床來。」是比丘尼羞瞋故，不復至是家。是居士後於市中見人賣床，即還奪取。遣使語比丘尼言：「以得先床，汝可還來。」</lzh>
That house was close to a large road. Shady people entered the gate and saw her sitting bench. They looked around and when there was nobody, they stole it and left. When the newly-wed wives didn’t hear the bhikkhunī, they said to each other: “Let’s go and see if she’s there.” Someone said: “She’s not there.” “Is the bench there?” One answered: “It’s not there.” They thought: “The bhikkhunī must have taken it to the monastery.” They sent a messenger to say: “Return our bench.” Because the bhikkhunī was ashamed and angry, she didn’t go to that house again. Later, that householder saw people selling the bench in the market, and he took it back. They sent a messenger to the bhikkhunī: “We’ve obtained our previous bench. Please return.”

<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，坐白衣床，不付囑主便去？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問偷蘭難陀比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責：「云何名比丘尼，坐白衣床，不還付主便去？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼，坐白衣床，不還付主便去，波夜提。」</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you sit on a lay person’s bench, and leave without informing the owner?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked Thullanandā bhikkhunī: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you sit on a lay person’s bench, and leave without informing the owner?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī sits on a lay person’s bench, and leaves without returning it to the owner, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼坐白衣床，不還付主便去，波夜提。隨不付去，隨得波夜提。(一百四十三事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī sits on a lay person’s bench, and leaves without returning it to the owner, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she leaves without returning it, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 143.)
