<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在王舍城。爾時助調達比丘尼，有大式叉摩尼，年少端正可愛，欲受大戒。有弊惡人見生貪著心，作是念：「比丘尼為王所守護，不得強奪。諸比丘尼法，應從比丘受大戒。若是式叉摩尼出受戒時，我當捉取將去。」是式叉摩尼出受大戒，是弊惡人強捉將去。</lzh>
The Buddha was in Rājagaha. At that time, the bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta had a sikkhamānā who was grown up, young, attractive, and pleasing, and who wanted to receive the higher ordination. An evil man saw her and craving and attachment arose in his mind. He thought: “Bhikkhunīs are protected by the king, it’s not allowed to rape them. According to the bhikkhunīs’ rules, they should receive higher ordination from the bhikkhus. When this sikkhamānā goes out to receive the higher ordination, I’ll abduct her.” When that sikkhamānā went out to receive the higher ordination, that evil man abducted her.
<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，不語僧坊中比丘尼出遠門去？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，不語僧坊中比丘尼出遠門去？」種種呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼，不語餘比丘尼出遠門去，波夜提。」</lzh>

Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you, without telling the bhikkhunīs in the monastery, go out by a remote gate?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. Because of this matter, the Buddha gathered both sanghas and criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you, without telling the bhikkhunīs in the monastery, go out by a remote gate?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī, without telling the other bhikkhunīs, goes out by a remote gate, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼，從比丘尼僧坊中不語餘比丘尼出門遠去，波夜提。隨不語出門，隨得爾所波夜提。(一百六十七事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī goes out from the bhikkhunī monastery by a remote gate without telling the other bhikkhunīs, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she goes through the gate without telling, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 167.)
