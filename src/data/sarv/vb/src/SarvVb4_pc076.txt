<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時有二比丘尼：一名羅吒，二名波羅吒，本出貴家。是二比丘尼早起，行至諸親里知識檀越家，得好飲食噉，皆言：「不美。」問言：「誰作此食？」主人答言：「厨士所作。」比丘尼言：「何以作無氣味食？」主人問言：「汝能作不？」比丘尼言：「能！若有好日欲作節會，若欲詣水上便來語我，我當為汝作飲食。」後時主人好日至，欲入園中，便喚比丘尼。是比丘尼來為作飲食，是家中有客作食人，護厨到門下立，見有熟食，來出問言：「誰煮是食？」主人答言：「有二比丘尼：一名羅吒，二名波羅吒，煮是食。」客作食人瞋言：「是失比丘尼法、燒比丘尼法，奪我生活業。」是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問二比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，煮生物作食？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, there were two bhikkhunīs, one called Luozha, the other Boluozha. They had originally gone forth from a rich family. These two bhikkhunīs, got up early, and went to the house of their relatives, acquaintances, and supporters. They received delicious drinks and food, ate it, and both said: “It’s not good.” They asked: “Who prepared this food?” The donors answered: “It was prepared by the cooks.” The bhikkhunīs said: “Why did they prepare food without fragrance and flavor?” The donors asked: “Can you prepare it?” The bhikkhunīs said: “We can. When there’s a nice day and you want to have an outing, or if you want to go on a boat trip, just come and speak with us. We’ll prepare food and drinks for you.” At a later time, when a nice day had come, the donors wanted to go to a park. Then they summoned the bhikkhunīs. The bhikkhunīs came to prepare food and drinks. In that household were people working as cooks. Supervising the kitchen, they stood in the door and saw that there was cooked food. They came out and asked: “Who has cooked this food?” The donors answered: “There are two bhikkhunīs, one called Luozha, the other Boluozha, who’ve cooked this food.” The people working as cooks said angrily: “They’ve lost and burnt their status as bhikkhunīs. They’re snatching away our livelihood.” 

Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked these two bhikkhunīs: “Did you really do this?” They answered: “We really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you cook raw things to prepare food?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus:


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>若比丘尼煮生物作食，波夜提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī cooks raw things to prepare food, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼煮生物作食，波夜提。隨煮，隨得爾所波夜提。</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī cooks raw things to prepare food, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she cooks, she incurs a pācittiya.

<lzh>不犯者，若重煮、若有急因緣，以火淨煮者，不犯。(七十六事竟)</lzh>
There’s no offense: If she reheats food, if there’s an urgent reason, or if she cooks to purify by fire,<note> I.e. the precedure to make food allowable. However, only people who’re not fully ordained can make food allowable, so I’m not sure why it’s mentioned here.</note>  the offense isn’t committed. (End of rule 76.)
