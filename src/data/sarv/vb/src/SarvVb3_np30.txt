<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時冬寒過至熱時，達摩提那比丘尼著重衣，頭面流汗眼闇而行乞食。有一估客見已，即往語諸鬪將言：「聚落主，汝等得富樂者，皆由達摩提那比丘尼因緣，汝等不能各各與作輕衣耶？是比丘尼今熱時著重衣，頭面流汗眼闇而行乞食，汝等若不能各各作輕衣與者，當共合作一衣與。」估客令諸鬪將發憍慢心，皆言：「當共作與。」即喚比丘尼來問言：「汝須何衣？隨汝意與。」答言：「我須二百五十錢直衣。」時諸鬪將隨意買與。是比丘尼著是衣行乞食，諸居士呵責言：「諸比丘尼自言：『善好有功德。』著貴價輕衣行乞食，如王夫人、大臣婦。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, the cold of the winter passed and summer came. Dhammadinnā bhikkhunī wore a heavy robe to go on almsround, with sweat streaming down her face and clouding her eyes. When a merchant saw it, he went to the generals, and said: “Village Chiefs, you’ve obtained prosperity because of bhikkhunī Dhammadinnā. Can’t you each make a light robe? This bhikkhunī now during the summer wears a thick robe to go on almsround, with sweat streaming down her face and clouding her eyes. If you can’t each make a light robe for her, you should make one robe together and give it.” Because the merchant caused pride to arise in the generals’ minds, they all said: “We’ll make one together and give it.” Then they summoned the bhikkhunī and asked: “What kind of robe do you need? We’ll give as you wish.” She answered: “I need a robe worth 250 coins.” Then the generals bought it according to her wish and gave it. This bhikkhunī wore this robe to go on almsround. The householders criticized her: “These bhikkhunīs say of themselves: ‘We’re virtuous and have merit’, but they wear an expensive light robe to go on almsround, like queens and wives of high officials.”

<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，著貴價輕衣行乞食？」種種因緣呵已向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問是比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，著貴價輕衣行乞食？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒，從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼欲乞輕衣，應乃至直二錢半。過是乞者，尼薩耆波夜提。」</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you wear an expensive light robe to go on almsround?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked that bhikkhunī: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you wear an expensive light robe to go on almsround?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī wants to ask for a light robe, she should ask for one up to a value of two and a half coins. If she asks for a more expensive one, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>錢者，謂大錢乃至直十六小錢。</lzh>
“A coin” means a large coin, up to a value of sixteen small coins.

<lzh>尼薩耆波夜提者，是衣應捨，波夜提罪應悔過。</lzh>
“A nissaggiya pācittiya” means that this robe should be relinquished, and the pācittiya offense should be confessed.

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼乞過二錢半輕衣，尼薩耆波夜提。隨乞，隨得爾所尼薩耆波夜提。(三十事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī asks for a light robe that’s worth more than two and a half coins, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. Whenever she asks, she incurs a nissaggiya pācittiya. (End of rule 30.)
