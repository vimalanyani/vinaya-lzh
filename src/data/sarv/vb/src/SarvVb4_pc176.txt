<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時迦留陀夷，與掘多比丘尼相識知舊，共語共事。時迦留陀夷，二月遊行他國，掘多比丘尼聞已心不喜。迦留陀夷二月遊行，還到舍衛國。掘多比丘尼聞已，洗浴莊嚴面目，香油塗髮著輕染衣，到迦留陀夷所，頭面禮足在前而坐。時迦留陀夷，生染著心諦視其面，比丘尼亦生染心，視比丘面。比丘尼作是念：「此視我面必生染著，我何不在前起行？」時迦留陀夷但著泥洹僧，共行來往欲心動發，畏犯戒故，不敢相觸，諦相視面便失不淨，離急熱已即還本坐。掘多比丘尼知失不淨，語迦留陀夷：</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, Kāḷudāyī and Guttā bhikkhunī were old friends, who talked and did things together.<note> According to the Mūlasarvāstivāda vinaya, Udāyī and Guttā were previously married. Cf. Mu bī np4.</note> Then Kāḷudāyī went wandering to another country for two months. When Guttā bhikkhunī heard it, she wasn’t happy. Kāḷudāyī wandered for two months and returned to Sāvatthī. When Guttā bhikkhunī heard it, she bathed, adorned her face and eyes, applied perfume and oil on her hair, put on a lightly dyed robe, and went to Kāḷudāyī. She paid respect with her head at his feet and sat in front of him. Then defiled attachment arose in Kāḷudāyī’s mind and he stared at her face. Defilements also arose in the bhikkhunī’s mind and she looked at the bhikkhu’s face. The bhikkhunī thought: “He looks at my face, and must have given rise to defiled attachment. Why don’t I get up and walk in front of him?” Then Kāḷudāyī was only wearing his lower robe. When they walked back and forth together, desire arose in his mind, and he feared to break the precepts. They didn’t dare touch each other, but when they stared at each others faces, he emitted semen. Withdrawing quickly from the heat, he returned to his previous seat. Guttā bhikkhunī knew that he had emitted semen, and said to Kāḷudāyī: 
<lzh>「持是衣來，我當與浣。」即脫衣與。比丘尼持是衣，小却一面綟衣，取汁分作二分，一分飲、一分著女根中，即時有福德人來受母胎。是比丘尼腹漸漸大，諸比丘尼言：「汝是犯婬欲人，驅出僧坊。」是比丘尼言：「我不作婬。」自說如上因緣。諸比丘尼不知云何？以是事向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問是比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛語諸比丘尼：「汝等莫說，是比丘尼此事，以如是因緣故得娠。」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼飲精？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼飲精，波夜提。」</lzh>
“Give me this robe, I’ll wash it.” Then he took off the robe and gave it to her. The bhikkhunī took this robe, stepped back a little to one side, and wrung out the robe. She took the liquid and divided it into two parts: she drank one part and inserted the other into her vagina. Then a meritorious being entered her womb. The bhikkhunī’s belly gradually grew, and the other bhikkhunīs said: “You’re someone who has had sexual intercourse. You’re expelled from the monastery.” The bhikkhunī said: “I haven’t engaged in sex.” She explained the reason as above. The bhikkhunīs didn’t know what to do. 

They explained the matter to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked that bhikkhunī: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha told the bhikkhunīs: “Don’t say that this bhikkhunī has done this thing (i.e. had sex). She has become pregnant for the reason (she gave).” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you drink semen?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī drinks semen, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼飲男子精，波夜提。隨飲，隨得爾所波夜提。(一百七十六事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī drinks a man’s semen, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she drinks it, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 176.)
