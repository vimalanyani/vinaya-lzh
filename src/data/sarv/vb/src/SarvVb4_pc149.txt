<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時有比丘尼名修闍多，端正姝好，人所喜見。有一長者兒，名欝多羅，舊相知識，共語共事。是兒住憍薩羅國鉢多羅聚落，是比丘尼為是兒故，離有比丘住處安居。</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, there was a bhikkhunī named Sujātā, who was attractive and beautiful. People liked to look at her. And there was a householder’s son called Uttara(?), who was an old friend of hers. They talked and did things together. That son was living in Kosala, in Pattagāma, and because of him, the bhikkhunī spent the rains retreat away from a bhikkhu residence. 

<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，離有比丘住處安居？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問修闍多：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，離有比丘住處安居？」種種呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼，離有比丘住處安居，波夜提。」</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you spend the rains retreat away from a bhikkhu residence?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked Sujātā: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you spend the rains retreat away from a bhikkhu residence?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī spends the rains retreat away from a bhikkhu residence, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼離有比丘住處安居，波夜提。隨離，隨得波夜提。(一百四十九事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī spends the rains retreat away from a bhikkhu residence, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she’s away, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 149.)
