<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時舍衛國，居士有婦不隨夫教，以手脚打驅出自舍。有比丘尼常入出是家，婦往至比丘尼所。是居士到餘聚落，作是念：「我婦將無走去耶？」還舍覓不得，居士念言：「我婦必往至比丘尼精舍。」居士復作是念：「置使在彼令好調伏，後當將還。」是婦五六日住已，語所知識比丘尼：「善女！何不度我？」答言：「汝婿尚在，云何度汝？」婦言：「夫不用我，若須我者，應當自來，亦當遣使。」比丘尼即度令出家。是居士聞婦出家，瞋恚語婦師言：「汝惡比丘尼、賊比丘尼，汝破我家。」「何故破汝家？」答言：「奪我婦作比丘尼。」比丘尼言：「此是汝婦，汝便將去。」諸居士呵責言：「諸比丘尼自言：『善好有功德。』主不聽便度他婦，如王夫人、大臣婦。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, in Sāvatthī, there was a householder whose a wife didn’t follow her husband’s instructions. He beat and kicked her with his hands and feet, and threw her out of his house. There was a bhikkhunī who often went in and out of that house, and the wife went to the bhikkhunī. The householder went to another village and thought: “My wife might have nowhere to go.” He returned to the house and looked for her, but didn’t find her. The householder thought: “My wife must have gone to the bhikkhunī monastery.” He also thought: “Being there will make her more submissive. I’ll fetch her later.” When the wife had stayed there for five or six days, she said to her bhikkhunī acquaintance: “Good woman, why don’t you ordain me?” She answered: “Your husband is still around. How could I ordain you?” The wife said: “My husband has no use for me. If he needed me, he would’ve come himself or sent a messenger.” Then the bhikkhunī gave her the going forth. The householder heard that his wife had gone forth, and he angrily said to his wife’s teacher: “You evil bhikkhunī, you criminal bhikkhunī, you’ve broken my family.” “Why have I broken your family?” He answered: “You’ve snatchend away my wife and made her a bhikkhunī.” The bhikkhunī said: “This is your wife. Just take her away.” The householders criticized her: “These bhikkhunīs say of themselves: ‘We’re virtuous and have merit’, but they just ordain wives when the guardians haven’t allowed it, like queens and wives of high officials.”

<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，主不聽便度他婦？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問是比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責：「云何名比丘尼，主不聽便畜為眾？」種種因緣呵責已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼，女人主不聽，畜為眾者，波夜提。」</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you just ordain a wife whose guardian hasn’t allowed it?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked that bhikkhunī: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you just take someone on as your student whose guardian hasn’t allowed it?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī takes on a woman as her student whose guardian hasn’t allowed it, it’s a pācittiya.’”

<lzh>主不聽者，有三種：若未嫁女；父母不聽；若已嫁未至夫家者，爾時兩邊不聽，若已至夫家，夫主不聽，波夜提。</lzh>
“The guardian hasn’t allowed it” means: There are three kinds: If the woman isn’t married yet, and her parents haven’t allowed it; or if she’s married but hasn’t gone to her husband’s home yet, and both sides haven’t allowed it; or if she has already gone to her husband’s home, and the husband hasn’t allowed it, it’s a pācittiya.


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼，夫主不聽便度，波夜提。隨不聽度，隨得波夜提。(一百二十四事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī just ordains someone whose husband hasn’t allowed it, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she ordains someone who hasn’t been allowed, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 124.)
