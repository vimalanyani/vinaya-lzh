<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時偷蘭難陀比丘尼，所望得衣弱，便受迦絺那衣。後時打犍搥捨迦絺那衣，偷蘭難陀比丘尼不欲來，遣比丘尼喚言：「僧欲捨迦絺那衣，汝來！」答言：「不去。」問：「何故不去？」偷蘭難陀言：「我所望衣未得。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, Thullanandā bhikkhunī had little hope of obtaining cloth, but she still accepted the kaṭhina robe. At a later time, when they struck the bell to relinquish the kaṭhina robe, Thullanandā bhikkhunī didn’t want to come. They sent a bhikkhunī to summon her: “The sangha wants to relinquish the kaṭhina robe. You should come!” She answered: “I won’t go.” (The messenger bhikkhunī) asked: “Why won’t you go?” Thullanandā said: “I haven’t obtained the cloth I hoped for yet.”

<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，所望得衣弱，而受迦絺那衣？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問偷蘭難陀比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責：「云何名比丘尼，所望得衣弱，而受迦絺那衣？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼所望得衣弱，而受迦絺那衣，波夜提。」</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you have little hope of obtaining cloth, but still accept the kaṭhina robe?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked Thullanandā bhikkhunī: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you have little hope of obtaining cloth, but still accept the kaṭhina robe?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī has little hope of obtaining cloth, but still accepts the kaṭhina robe, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼所望得衣弱，而受迦絺那衣，波夜提。隨所望得衣弱，隨受隨得波夜提。(一百三十五事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī has little hope of obtaining cloth, but still accepts the kaṭhina robe, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she has little hope of obtaining cloth, and whenever she accepts, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 135.)
