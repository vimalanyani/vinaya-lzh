<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在王舍城。爾時助調達比丘尼，故往觀聽歌舞伎樂、看莊嚴伎兒。諸居士呵責言：「諸比丘尼自言：『善好有功德。』故往觀聽歌舞伎樂、莊嚴伎兒，如王夫人、如大臣婦。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Rājagaha. At that time, the bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta intentionally went to watch and listen to singing, dancing, and musical performances, and to see costumed actors. The householders criticized them: “These bhikkhunīs say of themselves: ‘We’re virtuous and have merit’, but they intentionally go to watch and listen to singing, dancing, musical performances, and costumed actors, like queens and wives of high officials.”
<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問是比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，故往觀聽歌舞伎樂、莊嚴伎兒？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼，故往觀聽歌舞伎樂、莊嚴伎兒，波夜提。」</lzh>

Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked those bhikkhunīs: “Did you really do this?” They answered: “We really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you intentionally go to watch and listen to singing, dancing, musical performances, and costumed actors?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī intentionally goes to watch and listen to singing, dancing, musical performances, and costumed actors, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼，故往觀聽歌舞伎樂、莊嚴伎兒，得見者波逸提；不得見者，突吉羅。若從下至高得見，波夜提；不得見，突吉羅。若從高至下得見，波夜提；不得見，突吉羅。
不犯者，不故往道由中過，不犯。(一百六十一事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī intentionally goes to watch and listen to singing, dancing, musical performances, and costumed actors, and she’s able to see it, it’s a pācittiya. If she’s not able to see it, it’s a dukkaṭa. If she goes from below to a higher place to be able to see, it’s a pācittiya. If she’s not able to see, it’s a dukkaṭa. If she goes from above to a lower place to be able to see, it’s a pācittiya. If she’s not able to see, it’s a dukkaṭa.
There’s no offense: If she unintentionally walks on a road that passes by (a performance), the offense isn’t committed. (End of rule 161.)
