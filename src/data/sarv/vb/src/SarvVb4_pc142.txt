<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時助調達比丘尼，常入出他家。到他家中，居士婦言：「善女！汝掃灑、敷床榻、然火煮食、下食。」是比丘尼即隨所教。更有善比丘尼來到是家，居士婦言：「善女！汝掃灑、敷床榻、然火煮食、下食。」答言：「我是汝婢供養汝耶？今汝等坐，使我執作。」居士婦言：「汝惡性憍慢，助調達比丘尼來，隨我語作。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, the bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta often went in and out of someone’s house. When they reached that house, the lady of the house said: “Good women, sweep and mop, lay out beds, light a fire, cook food, and serve food.” Those bhikkhunīs then followed her instructions. Then virtuous bhikkhunīs arrived at that house and the lady said: “Good women, sweep and mop, lay out beds, light a fire, cook food, and serve food.” They answered: “Are we your slaves serving you? Now you sat down and have us do the work.” The lady of the house said: “You’re of bad character and arrogant. The bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta came and worked according to my instructions.”

<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責：「云何名比丘尼，與白衣掃灑、敷床榻、然火煮食、下食？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問助調達比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責：「云何名比丘尼，與白衣作？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼，與白衣作，波夜提。」</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you sweep and mop, lay out beds, light a fire, cook food, and serve food for lay people?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked the bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta: “Did you really do this?” They answered: “We really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you work for lay people?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī works for lay people, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼，白衣使掃地，掃者波夜提；若使灑地、敷床榻、然火煮食、煮羹、下食，作者波夜提。若隨語閉門，突吉羅。(一百四十二事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī, when lay people have her sweep the ground, sweeps, it’s a pācittiya. If they have her mop the ground, lay out beds, light a fire, cook food (i.e. rice), cook curries, or serve food, and she does it, it’s a pācittiya. If she closes the gate at their instruction, it’s a dukkaṭa. (End of rule 142.)
