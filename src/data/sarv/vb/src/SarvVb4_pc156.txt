<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時偷蘭難陀比丘尼，喜入出他家，早起行詣諸家，中庭立、大門中立、厨下立。是中若有沙門、婆羅門來，為乞食故來，偷蘭難陀比丘尼語言：「食未辦。」若言：「主人不在。」如是從家至家，遮諸乞食人。諸乞食人不得食故呵責言：「是不吉弊女慳惜他家，故令我等不得食。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, Thullanandā bhikkhunī liked to go in and out of people’s houses. She got up early, went to these houses, and stood in the middle courtyard, stood at the main gate, or stood in the kitchen. If renunciates and brahmins came on almsround, Thullanandā said: “Food hasn’t been prepared yet.” Or she said: “The owners aren’t home.” In this way, she went from house to house, and obstructed the alms seekers. Because the alms seekers didn’t receive food, they criticized her: “This inauspicious, inferior woman is stingy regarding families, and intentionally caused us not to receive food.”

<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問偷蘭難陀比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，護惜他家？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼護惜他家，波夜提。」</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked Thullanandā bhikkhunī: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you keep families to yourself?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī keeps families to herself, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼護惜白衣家，波夜提。隨護惜，隨得爾所波夜提。(一百五十六事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī keeps lay families to herself, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she keeps them to herself, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 156.)
