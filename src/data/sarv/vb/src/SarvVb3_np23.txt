<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時眾多居士、居士婦，為偷蘭難陀比丘尼故，各各辦衣價作是言：「我等以是衣價，買如是如是衣，與偷蘭難陀。」偷蘭難陀聞已問諸居士：「實爾不？」答言：「實爾。」問言：「是衣何似？」答言：「如是，如是。」比丘尼言：「善好！我等比丘尼貧窮，汝等不能常有施心，若不能得各各辦者，可共作如是如是一衣與我。」諸居士言：「爾。」諸居士先所辦衣價，更出再三倍價買衣。與比丘尼竟，瞋呵責言：「諸比丘尼不知時、不知量。若施者不知量，受者應知量。我等先所辦物，更再三倍出，我等不是失利，供養是難滿難養無厭足人。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, many male and female householders each prepared a robe fund for Thullanandā bhikkhunī and said: “With this robe fund, we’ll buy such-and-such a robe for Thullanandā.” When Thullanandā heard this, she asked the householders: “Is this true?” They answered: “It’s true.” She asked: “What kind of robe?” They answered: “Such-and-such.” The bhikkhunī said: “Sādhu! We bhikkhunīs are poor, and you’re not able to always maintain the intention of giving. If you can’t each prepare one individually, please make such-and-such a robe together for me.” The householders said: “Okay.” The householders bought a robe for three times the robe price they had previously prepared. When they had given it to the bhikkhunī, they angrily criticized her: “The bhikkhunīs don’t know the right time, and don’t know the limit. If the donors don’t know the limit, the recipients should know the limit. We spent three times the amount we previously prepared, and we did what’s inappropriate, we lost the merit, since we gave to this hard to satisfy, hard to support, immoderate person.”

<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問偷蘭難陀比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責：「云何名比丘尼，眾多非親里居士、居士婦作同意？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若為比丘尼故，眾多非親里居士、居士婦各各辦衣價，作是言：『我等持是衣價，各各買如是如是衣，與某甲比丘尼。』是比丘尼先不請，後到眾多居士、居士婦所，作是言：『汝等以是衣價，共買如是如是一衣與我，為好故。』是比丘尼得衣者，尼薩耆波夜提。」</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked Thullanandā bhikkhunī: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when many unrelated male and female householders have the same opinion about you?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If many unrelated male and female householders each prepare a robe fund for a bhikkhunī and say: “We’ll take these robe funds and each buy such-and-such a robe for bhikkhunī So-and-so,” and that bhikkhunī, without having been invited first, later goes to those many male and female householders and says: “With these robe funds, buy such-and-such a single robe together for me,” to get something good, and if that bhikkhunī obtains the robe, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>為比丘尼者，為偷蘭難陀。</lzh>
“For a bhikkhunī” means for Thullanandā.

<lzh>非親里者，親里名父母、兄弟，乃至七世因緣，除是名非親里。</lzh>
“Unrelated” means: Parents, siblings, down to connections through seven generations are called “related”. Everyone other than these is called “unrelated”.

<lzh>居士、居士婦者，白衣男名居士，白衣女名居士婦。</lzh>
“Male and female householders” means a lay man is called a male householder, a lay woman is called a female householder.

<lzh>衣者，白麻衣、赤麻衣、芻麻衣、翅夷羅衣、欽婆羅衣、劫貝衣、憍施耶衣。</lzh>
“A robe” means a robe of white hemp, red hemp, linen, owls’ wings<note> This is a mixed translation and transliteration of Pāli ulūkapakkha (owls’ wings): 翅 = wings; 夷羅 yíluó transliterates ulū(ka) = owl</note>, wool, cotton, or silk.

<lzh>衣價者，金銀、車𤦲、馬瑙乃至米穀。</lzh>
“A robe fund” means gold and silver, Tridacna stones, agate, down to rice and grain.

<lzh>如是如是衣者，如是價、如是色、如是量。</lzh>
“Such-and-such a robe” means of such-and-such price, such-and-such color and material<note> The Chinese text has only one character: 色, rūpa, but I translate it as “color and material”.</note>, or such-and-such measurements.

<lzh>與某甲比丘尼者，與偷蘭難陀。</lzh>
“For bhikkhunī So-and-so” means for Thullanandā.

<lzh>先不請者，眾多居士、居士婦，先不言：「汝有所須來至我家取。」</lzh>
“Without having been invited first” means that the many male and female householders haven’t said first: “If you need something, come and take it from our family.”

<lzh>同心者，信是居士隨我所索不瞋故。眾多居士共買如是如是一衣與我為好者，難滿難養無厭足故。</lzh>
“Having the same opinion” means faithful householders aren’t angry because I asked. Many householders bought such-and-such a single robe for me together, to get something good, (because I’m) hard to satisfy, hard to support, and immoderate.<note> This paragraph seems corrupted. It doesn’t comment on the rule, but on part of the origin story, and even then it uses a different expression: 同意 (origin story) vs. 同心 (word definition). That part of the origin story itself seem unusual and might have suffered from textual loss, because the Buddha criticizes her for the opinion householders have of her, instead of for what she did. The phrasing of this word definition doesn’t make much sense to me either. Moreover, it’s unclear why it’s phrased in the first person: 我. It seems jumbled, so the translation is my best guess.</note>

<lzh>若得是衣，尼薩耆波夜提。</lzh>
If she obtains that robe, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.

<lzh>尼薩耆波夜提者，是衣應捨，波夜提罪應悔過。</lzh>
“A nissaggiya pācittiya” means that this robe should be relinquished, and the pācittiya offense should be confessed.

<lzh>是中犯者，有三種：價、色、量。價者，若比丘尼到眾多居士所言：「汝等共買一錢直衣與我。」若得衣者，三種犯尼薩耆波夜提。三種者，若言：「與我一錢直衣。」若言：「眾共合。」若言：「合買一衣。」若不得，突吉羅。若言：「二錢、三錢乃至百錢直。」得衣者，三種犯尼薩耆波夜提。三種者，若言：「百錢直。」若言：「眾共合。」若言：「共買一衣。」不得者，突吉羅。是名價。</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: There are three kinds: Price, color and material, and measurements. “The price” means: If a bhikkhunī goes to many householders and says: “Buy a robe of the value of one coin together for me,” and if she obtains the robe, there are three ways how she commits the nissaggiya pācittiya. The three ways are: If she says: “Give me a robe of the value of one coin,” if she says: “Many people together,” or if she says: “Buy one robe together”. If she doesn’t obtain it, it’s a dukkaṭa. If she says: “A value of two coins, three coins, up to 100 coins,” and obtains the robe, she commits the nissaggiya pācittiya in three ways. The three ways are: If she says: “A value of 100 coins,” if she says: “Many people together,” or if she says: “Buy one robe together”. If she doesn’t obtain it, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “the price”. 

<lzh>色者，若比丘尼語居士言：「與我青衣。」得者，三種犯尼薩耆波夜提。三種者，若言：「青。」若言：「眾共合，若共買一衣。」不得者，突吉羅。黃、赤、白、黑、赤麻、白麻、芻麻、翅夷羅憍施耶衣、欽婆羅劫貝衣。得衣者，三種犯尼薩耆波夜提。三種者，若言：「劫貝。」若言：「眾共合。」若言：「共買一衣。」不得者，突吉羅。是名色。</lzh>
“The color and material” means: If a bhikkhunī says to many householders: “Give me a blue robe,” and she obtains it, she commits the nissaggiya pācittiya in three ways. The three ways are: If she says: “Blue,” if she says: “Many people together,” (or if she says:) “Buy one robe together”. If she doesn’t obtain it, it’s a dukkaṭa. (If she says:) “A yellow, red, white, black, red hemp, white hemp, linen, owls’ wings, silk, wool, or cotton robe,” and obtains the robe, she commits the nissaggiya pācittiya in three ways. The three ways are: If she says: “Cotton,” if she says: “Many people together,” or if she says: “Buy one robe together”. If she doesn’t obtain it, it’s a dukkaṭa. This is called “the color and material”. 

<lzh>量者，若比丘尼言：「與我四肘衣。」得衣者，三種犯尼薩耆波夜提。三種者，若言：「與我四肘衣。」若言：「眾共合。」若言：「共買一衣。」不得者，突吉羅。若言：「五肘六肘乃至十八肘衣。」得衣者，三種犯尼薩耆波夜提。三種者，若言：「十八肘。」若言：「眾共合。」若言：「共買一衣。」不得者，突吉羅。</lzh>
“The measurements” means: If a bhikkhunī says: “Give me a robe of four forearm’s lengths,” and if she obtains the robe, there are three ways how she commits the nissaggiya pācittiya. The three ways are: If she says: “Give me a robe of four forearm’s lengths,” if she says: “Many people together,” or if she says: “Buy one robe together”. If she doesn’t obtain it, it’s a dukkaṭa. If she says: “A robe of five forearm’s lengths, six forearm’s lengths, up to 18 forearm’s lengths,” and obtains the robe, she commits the nissaggiya pācittiya in three ways. The three ways are: If she says: “18 forearm’s lengths,” if she says: “Many people together,” or if she says: “Buy one robe together”. If she doesn’t obtain it, it’s a dukkaṭa. 
<lzh>若比丘尼，乞異衣得異衣、若乞青衣得黃，突吉羅。若乞青得赤、白、黑、白麻、赤麻、芻麻衣翅夷羅衣憍施耶衣、欽婆羅衣劫貝衣，皆突吉羅。如是等索異得異者，突吉羅。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī asks for one robe and obtains a different robe; if she asks for a blue robe and obtains a yellow one, it’s a dukkaṭa. If she asks for a blue robe and obtains a red, white, black, white hemp, red hemp, linen, owls’ wings, silk, wool, or cotton robe, all are dukkaṭas. In the same way if she asks for something and obtains something else, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>若從親里索、若自恣請、若不索自與，不犯。(第二十三事竟)</lzh>
If she asks from relatives, if she’s invited, if someone gives on their own without her asking, the offense isn’t committed. (End of rule 23.)
