<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時舍衛城王園精舍諸比丘尼，在中庭講堂內土埵上，有立作者、有紡者、有擘治者、有抖擻者、有作縈者、有纏手者。爾時眾多鬪將，到王園精舍，見諸比丘尼種種作，作是言：「若王聞者，諸麁㲲、細㲲、雜色㲲、欽婆羅，如是等物一時多辦。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, at the monastery in the king’s park in Sāvatthī, on the floor of the lecture hall in the middle courtyard, some bhikkhunīs stood around working, some spun thread, some broke it off, some shook it, some wound it up, and some wrapped it around their hands. Then many generals came to the king’s park monastery, saw the bhikkhunīs doing all kinds of work, and said: “Suppose the king were to hear that coarse cotton, fine cotton, multi-colored cotton, woolen cloth, and similar such items are all simultaneously being produced here.”

<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問諸比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，紡作？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼紡績，波夜提。」</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked those bhikkhunīs: “Did you really do this?” They answered: “We really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you engage in spinning?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī spins thread, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼紡績，波夜提。若縈、若績、若擘、若抖擻、若纏手，皆波夜提。隨動手，隨得波夜提。方便欲作，突吉羅。若還合縷，一轉一突吉羅。若為縫衣，繩綖乃至六兩，不犯。(一百四十六事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī spins thread, it’s a pācittiya. If she winds it, if she spins it, if she breaks it up, if she shakes it, or if she wraps it around her hands, all are pācittiyas. Whenever she moves her hands, she incurs a pācittiya. If she plans and wishes to do it, it’s a dukkaṭa. If she joins threads, each turn is a dukkaṭa. If for sewing a robe, she ties strings, up to six Liang<note> About 80 meters</note>, there’s no offense. (End of rule 146.)
