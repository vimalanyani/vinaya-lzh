<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在王舍城。爾時助調達比丘尼入檀越舍，獨與六群比丘共立共語竊語，遣共行比丘尼去。是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責：「云何名比丘尼，入白衣舍，獨與一比丘共立共語竊語？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問助調達比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，入白衣舍，獨與一比丘共立共語竊語？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼入白衣舍，獨與一比丘共立共語竊語，遣共行比丘尼去，求閑便故，波夜提。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Rājagaha. At that time, a bhikkhunī supporting Devadatta entered a supporter’s house, stood and secretly talked together with a group-of-six bhikkhu alone, and sent the bhikkhunī who had come with her away. 

Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you enter a lay house, and stand and secretly talk together with one bhikkhu alone?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked the bhikkhunī supporting Devadatta: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you enter a lay house, and stand and secretly talk together with one bhikkhu alone?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī enters a lay house, and stands and secretly talks together with one bhikkhu alone, and sends the bhikkhunī who came with her away, because she seeks an opportunity for privacy, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼入白衣舍，獨與一比丘共立，突吉羅；共語，突吉羅；共竊語，突吉羅。求閑便故，遣共行比丘尼離聞處去，波逸提。不離聞處，突吉羅。(九十事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī enters a lay house, and stands together with one bhikkhu alone, it’s a dukkaṭa. If they talk together, it’s a dukkaṭa. If they secretly talk together, it’s a dukkaṭa. If, because she seeks an opportunity for privacy, she sends the bhikkhunī who came with her out of earshot, it’s a pācittiya. If she’s not out of earshot, it’s a dukkaṭa. (End of rule 90.)
