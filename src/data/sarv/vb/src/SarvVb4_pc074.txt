<h2>First Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時偷蘭難陀比丘尼，以指刺女根中。諸比丘尼問言：「汝作何等？」答言：「受細滑故。」是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，以指刺女根中，受細滑故？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問偷蘭難陀：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責：「云何名比丘尼，以指刺女根中，為細滑故？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, Thullanandā bhikkhunī inserted her finger into the vagina. The bhikkhunīs asked her: “What are you doing?” She answered: “Feeling a fine and smooth touch.”

Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized her: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you insert your finger into the vagina to feel a fine and smooth touch?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked Thullanandā: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you insert your finger into the vagina to feel a fine and smooth touch?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus:


<h2>First Preliminary Ruling</h2>

<lzh>若比丘尼以指刺女根中，波夜提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī inserts her finger into the vagina, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>First Preliminary Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼以指刺女根中，波夜提。隨著，隨得爾所波夜提。 </lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī inserts her finger into the vagina, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she touches it, she incurs a pācittiya.


<h2>Second Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>一時有比丘尼，久不洗女根故臭爛，諸比丘尼以是事白佛。佛以是事集二部僧，讚戒、讚持戒，讚戒、讚持戒已，語諸比丘：「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
One time, there was a bhikkhunī who stank because she hadn’t washed her vagina for a long time. The bhikkhunīs spoke with the Buddha about this matter, and he therefore gathered both sanghas. He praised the precepts and praised keeping precepts. Having praised the precepts and praised keeping the precepts, he said to the bhikkhus: “From now on, this precept should be recited thus:


<h2>Second Preliminary Ruling</h2>

<lzh>若比丘尼以指刺女根中，除洗時，波夜提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī inserts her finger into the vagina, except when washing herself, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Second Preliminary Explanations</h2>

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼不洗，以指刺女根中，波夜提。隨著，隨得爾所波夜提。</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī, when not washing herself, inserts her finger into the vagina, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she touches it, she incurs a pācittiya.


<h2>Third Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>又比丘尼洗因緣故，以指深刺女根中，諸比丘尼以是事白佛。佛以是事集二部僧，語諸比丘：「從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
There was another bhikkhunī, who in order to wash herself, inserted the finger deeply into the vagina. The bhikkhunīs spoke with the Buddha about this matter, and he therefore gathered both sanghas, and said to the bhikkhus: “From now on, this precept should be recited thus:


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>若比丘尼洗時，以指刺女根中，過二指節，波夜提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī, when washing herself, inserts her finger into the vagina deeper than two finger joints, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Final Explanations</h2>

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼以指刺女根中，洗時過二指節波夜提。隨著，隨得爾所波夜提。(七十四竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī inserts her finger into the vagina when washing herself, and she goes deeper that two finger joints, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she touches it, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 74.)
