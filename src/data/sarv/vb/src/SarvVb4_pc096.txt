<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在王舍城，自恣竟二月遊行他國，舍利弗、目連、阿那律、難提、金毘羅等諸大弟子，皆從佛遊行他國，是諸比丘尼住不去。諸居士呵責言：「佛在王舍城，自恣竟二月遊行他國，與大弟子舍利弗、目連、阿那律、難提、金毘羅等遊行，諸比丘尼不去。不善小女，不欲出是房舍。」是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問諸比丘尼。汝等實爾不？答言：「實爾。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，自恣竟不遊行餘處一宿？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼自恣竟，不遊行餘處一宿，波夜提。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Rājagaha. After the invitation ceremony, he wandered to other countries for two months and all the great disciples, Sāriputta, Moggallāna, Anuruddha, Nandiya, Kimbila, etc., followed the Buddha and wandered to other countries. But the bhikkhunīs stayed on and didn’t go. The householders criticized them: “The Buddha was in Rājagaha. After the invitation ceremony, he wandered to other countries for two months and the great disciples, Sāriputta, Moggallāna, Anuruddha, Nandiya, Kimbila, etc., wandered, but the bhikkhunīs didn’t go. The unskillful, inferior women don’t want to leave this residence.” 

Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked the bhikkhunīs: “Did you really do this?” They answered: “We really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you, after the invitation ceremony, don’t go to another place for one night?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus:


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī, after the invitation ceremony, doesn’t wander to another place for one night, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼自恣竟，不遊行餘處一宿，波夜提。隨不去，隨得爾所波夜提。(九十六事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī, after the invitation ceremony, doesn’t wander to another place for one night, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she doesn’t go, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 96.)
