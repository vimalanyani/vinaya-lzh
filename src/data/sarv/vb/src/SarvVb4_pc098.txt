<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在王舍城。爾時阿闍世王國界邊，有小國反，集四種兵：象兵、馬兵、車兵、步兵，集四種兵已王自往伐。諸比丘尼，從跋耆國向王舍城，道中見王軍。是中有長老比丘尼知法，遙見軍來言：「我等避去。」諸年少不知法比丘尼言：「何苦是？阿闍世王信佛法，阿婆跋陀童子、耆婆童子、阿盧耶，皆信敬佛法，我等但當直去。」語已直去，為前行軍人剝脫裸形。諸比丘尼白王言：「前行軍人剝脫我等。」王言：「此諸兵眾我悉供給聚落金銀廩賞爾乃鬪耳。今奪汝等衣不可還得。今國外疑處、畏處，汝等何以遊行？若佛聞是事，必當與汝等結戒：諸比丘尼國外疑處畏處不應遊行。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Rājagaha. At that time, a small country next to the territory of king Ajātasattu rebeled. He assembled four kinds of soldiers: elephant troops, cavalry, charioteers, and infantry. Having assembled four kinds of soldiers, the king himself went out to battle. The bhikkhunīs were wandering from the Vajjian country towards Rājagaha. On the way, they saw the king’s army. Among them were senior bhikkhunīs who knew the dhamma. They saw the army coming in the distance and said: “Let’s avoid them.” The young bhikkhunīs who didn’t know the dhamma said: “What’s the problem? King Ajātasattu has faith in the Buddha’s dhamma, prince Udāyibhadda, Jīvaka Komārabhacca, and Abhaya all have faith in and respect for the Buddha’s dhamma. We’ll just go straight there.” Having spoken, they went straight there, and they were robbed by the advance party and their bodies were exposed. The bhikkhunīs told the king: “The advance party robbed and undressed us.” The king said: “I provide villages, gold, silver, and grain as rewards to these troops. Only then they fight for me. Now the robes they’ve stolen from you can’t be returned. Outside this country is a dubious, frightening place now, why did you wander here? If the Buddha hears of this matter, he must lay down a precept for you: ‘The bhikkhunīs shouldn’t wander in a dubious, frightening place outside the country.’”

<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問諸比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，國外疑處、畏處遊行？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼國外疑處畏處遊行，波逸提。」</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked the bhikkhunīs: “Did you really do this?” They answered: “We really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you wander in a dubious, frightening place outside the country?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī wanders in a dubious, frightening place outside the country, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波逸提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼國外疑處畏處遊行，波逸提。隨遊行，隨得爾所波逸提。(九十八事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī wanders in a dubious, frightening place outside the country, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she wanders, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 98.)
