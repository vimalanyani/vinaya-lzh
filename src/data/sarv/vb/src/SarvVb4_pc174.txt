<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時王園比丘尼精舍門前有好草地，淨潔故多人眾集。是中多有弊惡人，見諸比丘尼出入時，便形相說其過罪，共相謂言：「是睞眼、是爛眼、是癭、是黑、是白、是好、是醜、是有威德、是無威德。」諸比丘尼聞是事心不喜，作是念：「諸人集此者，以是好草故，我等何不壞是草耶？」即大小便其上，草即乾死。諸居士呵責言：「不吉弊女，更無餘行處耶？淨草中大小便。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, in front of the gate of the bhikkhunī monastery in the king’s park, there was a nice meadow. Because it was clean, many people gathered in crowds. Among them were many evil men. When they saw the bhikkhunīs enter and leave, they commented on their bodies’ flaws. They said to each other: “This one squints, that one has sore eyes, this one has a goiter, this one is black, that one is white, this one is good-looking, that one is ugly, this one is dignified, that one is undignified.” The bhikkhunīs heard of this matter and their minds weren’t pleased. They thought: “These people gather here because of the nice grass. Why don’t we spoil the grass?” Then they defecated and urinated there, and the grass dried up and died. The householders criticized them: “Inauspicious, inferior women, is there no other place to go? You defecated and urinated on the clean grass.”

<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問諸比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣訶責言：「云何名比丘尼，生草上大小便？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼生草上大小便，波夜提。」</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked the bhikkhunīs: “Did you really do this?” They answered: “We really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you defecate and urinate on fresh grass?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī defecates and urinates on fresh grass, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼生草上大小便，波夜提。隨生草上大小便，隨得爾所波夜提。(一百七十四事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī defecates and urinates on fresh grass, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she defecates and urinates on fresh grass, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 174.)
