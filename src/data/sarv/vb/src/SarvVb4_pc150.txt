<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在王舍城。爾時助調達比丘尼，安居竟不二部僧中求三事自恣說見聞疑罪。</lzh>
The Buddha was in Rājagaha. At that time, the bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta, when the rains retreat had ended, didn’t invite both sanghas with regards to the three things: to speak about seen, heard, or suspected offenses.

<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，安居竟不二部僧中求三事自恣說見聞疑罪？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問助調達比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，安居竟不二部僧中求三事自恣說見聞疑罪？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼安居竟，不二部僧中求三事自恣說見聞疑，波夜提。」</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you, when the rains retreat has ended, don’t invite both sanghas with regards to the three things: to speak about seen, heard, or suspected offenses?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked the bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta: “Did you really do this?” They answered: “We really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you, when the rains retreat has ended, don’t invite both sanghas with regards to the three things: to speak about seen, heard, or suspected offenses?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī, when the rains retreat has ended, doesn’t invite both sanghas with regards to the three things: to speak about seen, heard, or suspected (offenses), it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼安居竟，不於二部僧中求三事自恣說見聞疑罪，波夜提。隨不求三事自恣說，隨得波夜提。(一百五十事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī, when the rains retreat has ended, doesn’t invite both sanghas with regards to the three things: to speak about seen, heard, or suspected offenses, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she doesn’t invite to speak about the three things, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 150.)
