<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時偷蘭難陀比丘尼，畜眾不與財法。諸弟子言：「和上尼何不與我等財法？」偷蘭難陀比丘尼言：「我不與汝等財法。」諸弟子言：「若不以財法與我等者，當餘處去。」偷蘭難陀言：「佛結戒，汝等應二歲隨逐我，若餘處去得波逸提罪。」是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，畜弟子不與財法？」種種因緣呵已向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，畜弟子不與財法？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼畜弟子不與財法，波逸提。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, Thullanandā bhikkhunī took on students and didn’t give them requisites and the dhamma. The students said: “Preceptor, why don’t you give us requisites and the dhamma?” Thullanandā bhikkhunī said: “I don’t give you requisites and the dhamma.” The students said: “If you don’t give us requisites and the dhamma, we’ll go to another place.” Thullanandā said: “The Buddha has laid down a precept that you should follow me for two years. If you go to another place, you incur a pācittiya offense.” 

Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you take on students and don’t give them requisites and the dhamma?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you take on students and don’t give them requisites and the dhamma?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī takes on a student and doesn’t give her requisites and the dhamma, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波逸提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼畜眾不與財法，波逸提。隨不與，隨得爾所波逸提。(一百一十四事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī takes on a student and doesn’t give her requisites and the dhamma, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she doesn’t give them, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 114.)
