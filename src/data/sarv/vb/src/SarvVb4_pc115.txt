<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時偷蘭難陀比丘尼，畜婬女為眾。是婬女比丘尼，中前著衣持鉢，入舍衛城乞食。是中有居士作是言：「我曾共是比丘尼，作如是如是事。」此比丘尼聞是事心不喜，向諸比丘尼說，諸比丘尼以是事向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問偷蘭難陀比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，畜婬女為眾？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「從今不應畜婬女為眾。畜者，突吉羅。若有因緣畜者，應將遠本處，五由延若六由延。以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼畜婬女為眾，不遠本處五六由延，波逸提。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, Thullanandā bhikkhunī took on a prostitute as her student. That prostitute bhikkhunī, before midday, put on her robes, took her bowl, and entered Sāvatthī on almsround. There, there were householders who said: “We’ve done such and such things together with that bhikkhunī.” 

When that bhikkhunī heard about this matter, her mind wasn’t pleased. She told it to the bhikkhunīs, and they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked Thullanandā bhikkhunī: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you take on a prostitute as your student?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “From now on, you shouldn’t take on a prostitute as your student. If someone takes one on, it’s a dukkaṭa. If there’s a reason to take her on, one should take her five or six yojanas away from her original place. For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī takes on a prostitute as her student and doesn’t take her five or six yojanas away from her original place, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波逸提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼畜婬女為眾，不遠本處五六由延，波逸提。隨不遠去，隨得爾所波逸提。(一百一十五事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī takes on a prostitute as her student and doesn’t take her five or six yojanas away from her original place, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she doesn’t take her away, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 115.)
