<h2>First Aspect</h2>

<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時有比丘尼，名跋陀，是加毘羅婆羅門女。跋陀比丘尼有姊死，往問訊姊夫，因為說法，遂至日沒。比丘尼作是念：「我若還精舍，恐道中有賊。」即住居士舍。是居士思惟：「此比丘尼不還去者，必欲得反戒，我當求令代其姊處。」作是念已語比丘尼言：「我舍多有財物珍寶，汝姊所有手脚頭面莊嚴具悉在。我若更取餘人作婦，則不能好看我兒，兒亦不愛樂。汝若欲反戒者，作我兒母，汝看我兒如兒，我兒等看汝如母。」比丘尼作是念：「若我違逆是語者，或強逼我。何不默然！」即默然坐。居士心念謂欲反戒，但以姊新死故默然，中夜復作是語，後夜復作是語。地了時是比丘尼，從急惱處得脫，還至精舍，向諸比丘尼廣說是事。</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, there was a bhikkhunī called Bhaddā, a Kapilan brahmin women. Bhaddā bhikkhunī’s older sister died, and she went and checked on her sister’s husband. While she spoke on dhamma, the time of sunset came. The bhikkhunī thought: “If I return to the monastery, I fear that there might be criminals on the way.” Then she stayed at the householder’s house. This householder thought: “This bhikkhunī hasn’t returned. It must be because she wants to disrobe. I’ll try to make her take her sister’s place.” Having thought that, he said to the bhikkhunī: “My house has much wealth and many jewels. All of your sister’s adornments for the hands, feet, head and face are here. If I take someone else as my wife, she might not look after my children well, and my children might not be happy. If you want to disrobe, and be the mother of my children, you can regard my children as your children, and my children will regard you as their mother.” The bhikkhunī thought: “If I oppose his words, he might force me. Why don’t I remain silent?” Then she sat there silently. The householder thought that that meant that she wanted to disrobe, and was just silent because of her sister’s recent death. In the middle of the night, he repeated his words, and at the end of the night, he again repeated them. When it got light outside, the bhikkhunī was able to escape this troublesome place. She returned to the monastery and told the bhikkhunīs in detail about this matter.

<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，一身獨宿？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問跋陀比丘尼汝實作是事不？答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，一身獨宿？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼一身獨宿，乃至一夜，是法初犯僧伽婆尸沙可悔過。」</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you spend the night alone?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked Bhaddā bhikkhunī: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you spend the night alone?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>First Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī spends the night alone, even just one night, that act is an immediate saṅghādisesa, from which one can repent.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>夜者，從日沒至地未了，是中間名夜。</lzh>
“A night” means from sunset to before it’s light outside (again), in between is called “night”.

<lzh>僧伽婆尸沙者，是罪屬僧，僧中有殘，因僧前悔過除滅，是名僧伽婆尸沙。</lzh>
“A saṅghādisesa” means this offense is dependent upon the sangha, and in the sangha there’s a remainder. Because she confesses and clears it in front of the sangha, therefore it’s called a saṅghādisesa. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼，日沒時一身獨宿，至地了時，犯僧伽婆尸沙。日沒已，初夜初分、初夜中分、初夜後分，中夜初分、中夜中分、中夜後分，後夜初分、後夜中分、後夜後分亦如是。又比丘尼，地了時一身獨宿，乃至明日地了時，犯僧伽婆尸沙。</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī at sunset spends the night alone until it’s light outside (again), she commits a saṅghādisesa. Likewise after the sun has set, in the first part of the first watch of the night, in the middle part of the first watch of the night, in the last part of the first watch of the night, in the first part of the second watch of the night, in the middle part of the second watch of the night, in the last part of the second watch of the night, in the first part of the last watch of the night, in the middle part of the last watch of the night, in the last part of the last watch of the night. And also if a bhikkhunī, when it’s light outside, spends the night alone until it’s light outside (again) the next day, she commits a saṅghādisesa.

<lzh>若共行比丘尼，若反戒、若死、若入外道、若八難中隨有一一難起，不犯。(第六戒有四事中一事竟)</lzh>
If bhikkhunīs go together and one disrobes, dies, joins non-Buddhist renunciates, or if any of the eight difficulties arise, the offense isn’t committed. (End of the first of four aspects of rule 6.)


<h2>Second Aspect</h2>

<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時有比丘尼，名偷蘭難陀，多知多識，喜入出諸家。是比丘尼早起著衣，入一家出一家，出一家復入一家。晡時來還大疲極，僧房中臥，自言：「脚痛、𨄔痛、脇痛、背痛。」語諸比丘尼：「與我按摩。」諸比丘尼言：「善女！從何處來？」答言：「入某家出某家，出某家復入某家。」問言：「汝為佛事僧事耶？」答言：「不為！」諸比丘尼言：「若不為佛事僧事去者，何以故為作是行得大疲極？」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, there was a bhikkhunī called Thullanandā, who had much understanding and knowledge, and liked to go in and out of houses. This bhikkhunī got up early, put on her robes, entered a house, left that house, entered another house, and left it again. Late in the afternoon, she returned very exhausted, lay down in the sangha building, and said to herself: “My feet hurt, my calves hurt, my flanks hurt, and my back hurts.” She said to the other bhikkhunīs: “Give me a massage.” The bhikkhunīs said: “Good woman, where did you come from?” She answered: “I entered such-and-such’s house and left it again, then I entered such-and-such’s house and left it again.” They asked: “Did you attend to matters of the Buddha or the sangha?” She answered: “I didn’t attend to that.” The bhikkhunīs said: “If you didn’t go to attend to matters of the Buddha or the sangha, why did you engage in this activity that made you extremely exhausted?” 

<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，晝日一身獨行？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問偷羅難陀比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，晝日一身獨行到白衣家？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼，若夜、若晝，一身獨行到白衣家，是法初犯僧伽婆尸沙可悔過。」</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you walk around alone during the day?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked Thullanandā bhikkhunī: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you go to lay houses alone during the day?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Second Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī goes to lay houses alone, whether at night or during the day, that act is an immediate saṅghādisesa, from which one can repent.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>晝日者，從地了至日未沒，是中間名晝日。</lzh>
“During the day” means from when it’s light outside to before sunset, in between is called “day”.

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼一身獨行，地了時去、至日沒時來，犯僧伽婆尸沙。日出時、日出已，中前日、中日昳，晡時、日沒時去、日沒已來還，皆僧伽婆尸沙。</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī walks alone, and she goes when it’s light outside and comes back at sunset, she commits a saṅghādisesa. If she goes at sunrise, after sunrise, before midday, at midday, after midday, in the late afternoon, at sunset, and returns after sunset, all are saṅghādisesas.

<lzh>若共行比丘尼，若反戒、若死、若入外道、若八難中隨有一一難起，不犯。(二事竟)</lzh>
If bhikkhunīs go together and one disrobes, dies, joins non-Buddhist renunciates, or if any of the eight difficulties arise, the offense isn’t committed. (End of the second aspect.)


<h2>Third Aspect</h2>

<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。偷蘭難陀比丘尼，喜見男子故，晨朝至城門下立，看男子出入誰好、誰醜。見一男子出，端正生著心，問言：「汝欲何去？」答言：「詣某聚落。」偷蘭難陀言：「我共汝去。」居士言：「隨意。」是比丘尼於道中，共居士戲笑語言大喚。居士有因緣故入聚落，是比丘尼無事，於聚落外立待居士。居士又入第二聚落，比丘尼亦復在外立待。居士又入第三聚落，是比丘尼晡時來還僧房中臥，語諸比丘尼言：「我大疲極，脚痛、𨄔痛、膝痛、脇痛、背痛，與我按摩。」諸比丘尼言：「汝從何來？」答言：「我從聚落至一聚落來。」問：「汝為佛事僧事耶？」答言：「不為！」諸比丘尼言：「若不為佛事僧事去者，何故為作是行得大疲極？」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. Because Thullanandā bhikkhunī liked to see men, she went and stood at the city gate in the morning. She watched men come and go to see who was good-looking and who was ugly. She saw one man come out who was attractive, and attachment arose in her mind. She asked: “Where do you want to go?” He answered: “I’m going to such-and-such village.” Thullanandā said: “I’ll go with you.” The householder said: “As you please.” On the way, that bhikkhunī and the householder amused themselves together and spoke loudly. Because the householder had a reason, he entered the village. The bhikkhunī had nothing to do and stood outside the village waiting for the householder. The householder also entered a second village, and the bhikkhunī stood outside and waited again. The householder also entered a third village, and this bhikkhunī returned late in the afternoon and lay down in the sangha building. She said to the other bhikkhunīs: “I’m very exhausted. My feet hurt, my calves hurt, my knees hurt, my flanks hurt, and my back hurts. Give me a massage.” The bhikkhunīs said: “Where did you come from?” She answered: “I went from village to village.” They asked: “Did you attend to matters of the Buddha or the sangha?” She answered: “I didn’t attend to that.” The bhikkhunīs said: “If you didn’t go to attend to matters of the Buddha or the sangha, why did you engage in this activity that made you extremely exhausted?” 

<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，獨一身至餘聚落？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問偷蘭難陀比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，獨一身往餘聚落？」種種因緣呵責已語諸比丘：「從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼，若夜、若晝，一身獨行往餘聚落，初犯僧伽婆尸沙可悔過。」</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you walk to other villages alone?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked Thullanandā bhikkhunī: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you go to other villages alone?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Third Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī goes to other villages alone, whether at night or during the day, she commits an immediate saṅghādisesa, from which one can repent.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>行者，有二種：水道行、陸道行。</lzh>
“Going” means there are two kinds: Going on a waterway, going on a path overland. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼，陸道一人獨行往餘聚落，僧伽婆尸沙。中道還，偷蘭遮。若無聚落空地，乃至一拘盧舍，僧伽婆尸沙。中道還，偷蘭遮。水道亦如是。</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī walks alone to another village overland, it’s a saṅghādisesa. If she returns midway, it’s a thullaccaya. If it’s a wilderness without villages, even one kosa is a saṅghādisesa. If she returns midway, it’s a thullaccaya. Likewise for waterways.

<lzh>若共行比丘尼，若反戒、若死、若入外道、若八難中隨有一一難起，不犯。(第五事竟)</lzh>
If bhikkhunīs go together and one disrobes, dies, joins non-Buddhist renunciates, or if any of the eight difficulties arise, the offense isn’t committed. (End of the third aspect.)<note> The Chinese text says “the fifth aspect,” but that’s clearly a mistake.</note>


<h2>Fourth Aspect</h2>

<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時諸比丘尼遊行憍薩羅國，向舍衛國，道中至河岸上住言：「誰能先入水看深淺？」是中有比丘尼，名修目佉，勦健多力，出婆羅門家，作是言：「我能先入。」即便入水渡到彼岸，水尋瀑漲不能得還。獨彼岸宿，夜有賊來剝衣裸形。</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, the bhikkhunīs were wandering in the country of Kosala towards Sāvatthī, and on the way came to a river. They stood on the bank and said: “Who can enter the water first and see how deep it is?” Among them was a bhikkhunī called Sumuttā, who was nimble, sturdy, and strong, and had gone forth from a brahmin family. She said: “I can enter first.” Then she entered the water and crossed over to the other bank. Soon afterwards, the water developed a strong current and was flooding, and she was unable to return. She spent the night alone on the other bank. During the night, criminals came, stole her robes and left her naked.

<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責：「云何名比丘尼，獨彼岸宿？」種種因緣呵責已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問修目佉比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責：「云何名比丘尼，獨彼岸宿？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼，若夜、若晝，若異聚落、若異界，若渡河彼岸一身獨宿，是法初犯僧伽婆尸沙可悔過。」</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you spend the night on the other riverbank alone?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked Sumuttā bhikkhunī: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you spend the night on the other riverbank alone?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Fourth Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī crosses a river and spends the night alone on the other bank, whether at night or during the day, whether in a different village or in a different territory, that act is an immediate saṅghādisesa, from which one can repent.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>河者。有二種：一者脫衣得渡，二者不脫衣得渡。有兩岸中有水來去處隨岸中流，是名為河。</lzh>
“A river” means there are two kinds: 1) One is able to cross after removing one’s robes. 2) One is able to cross without removing one’s robes. If between two banks, there’s a place where water is coming and going, and it flows along in between the banks, it’s called “a river”.

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼，獨一身脫衣渡河，僧伽婆尸沙；中道還，偷蘭遮。若二比丘尼共渡河，一渡一還，渡者僧伽婆尸沙，還者偷蘭遮。若比丘尼脫衣渡池水，渡者偷蘭遮，中道還者突吉羅。若二比丘尼共渡池水，一渡一還，渡者偷蘭遮，還者突吉羅。若比丘尼褰衣渡河，渡者偷蘭遮，中道還者突吉羅。若二比丘尼褰衣渡河，一渡一還，渡者偷蘭遮，還者突吉羅。若比丘尼褰衣獨渡池水，渡者突吉羅，中道還者亦突吉羅。若二比丘尼褰衣渡池水，一渡一還，渡者突吉羅，還者亦突吉羅。</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī crosses a river alone while removing her robes, it’s a saṅghādisesa. If she returns midway, it’s a thullaccaya. If two bhikkhunīs cross a river together, and one crosses and the other returns, it’s a saṅghādisesa for the one who crosses, and a thullaccaya for the one who returns. If a bhikkhunī crosses a moat while removing her robes, it’s a thullaccaya for one who crosses, and a dukkaṭa for one who returns midway. If two bhikkhunīs cross a moat together, and one crosses and the other returns, it’s a thullaccaya for the one who crosses, and a dukkaṭa for the one who returns. If a bhikkhunī crosses a river while pulling her robes up, it’s a thullaccaya for one who crosses, and a dukkaṭa for one who returns midway. If two bhikkhunīs cross a river together while pulling their robes up, and one crosses and the other returns, it’s a thullaccaya for the one who crosses, and a dukkaṭa for the one who returns. If a bhikkhunī crosses a moat alone while pulling her robes up, it’s a dukkaṭa for one who crosses, and also a dukkaṭa for one who returns midway. If two bhikkhunīs cross a moat together while pulling their robes up, and one crosses and the other returns, it’s a dukkaṭa for the one who crosses, and also a dukkaṭa for the one who returns.

<lzh>若從橋梁船渡，不犯。若共渡比丘尼，若反戒、若死、若入外道、若八難中隨有一一難起，不犯。(第六事竟)</lzh>
If she crosses on a bridge, a beam, or with a boat, the offense isn’t committed. If bhikkhunīs cross together, and one disrobes, dies, joins non-Buddhist renunciates, or if any of the eight difficulties arise, the offense isn’t committed. (End of the fourth aspect.)<note> The Chinese text says “the sixth aspect,” but that’s clearly a mistake.</note>
