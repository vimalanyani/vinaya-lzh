<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時偷蘭難陀比丘尼，畜孝女為眾。是孝女比丘尼，不誦經、不問答、不坐禪。諸比丘尼問言：「汝何以故不讀誦經、問答、坐禪？」答言：「諸善女！我父死、若母死、兄弟死、姊妹兒女死、夫婿死故憂愁。云何能讀誦經、問答、坐禪？」是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責：「云何名比丘尼，畜孝女為眾？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問偷蘭難陀比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，畜孝女為眾？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼畜孝女為眾，波逸提。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, Thullanandā bhikkhunī took on mourning women as her students. Those mourning bhikkhunīs didn’t recite suttas, didn’t discuss (dhamma), and didn’t sit in meditation. The bhikkhunīs asked: “Why don’t you recite suttas, discuss (dhamma), and sit in meditation?” They answered: “Good women, because our father died, our mother died, our brothers died, our sisters died, our children died, or our husbands died, we’re gieving. How could we recite suttas, discuss (dhamma), and sit in meditation?” 

Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized (Thullanandā) with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you take on mourning women as your students?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked Thullanandā bhikkhunī: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you take on mourning women as your students?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī takes on a mourning woman as her student, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波逸提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼畜孝女為眾，波逸提。隨畜，隨得爾所波逸提。(一百一十八事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī takes on a mourning woman as her student, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she takes one on, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 118.)
