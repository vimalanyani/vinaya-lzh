<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時有一居士，欲與比丘尼僧衣。偷蘭難陀比丘尼，常入出是家，聞已往問言：「汝實欲與比丘尼僧衣耶？」答言：「實爾。」偷蘭難陀言：「比丘尼僧多有衣，厚舉畜腐爛不能用，汝今有事且出城，還更自思惟。」以是因緣故，是衣竟不與比丘尼僧。是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，居士欲與比丘尼僧衣，遮令不與？」種種因緣呵責已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問偷蘭難陀比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，居士欲與比丘尼僧衣，遮令不與？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼遮與僧衣，波夜提。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, there was a householder who wanted to give robes to the bhikkhunī sangha. Thullanandā bhikkhunī often went in and out of their house. When she heard this, she went and asked: “Do you really want to give robes to the bhikkhunī sangha?” They answered: “Yes.” Thullanandā said: “The bhikkhunī sangha has many robes, stored in large piles that decay, and can’t be used up. You now have things to do out of town. When you return, you can still think about this.” For this reason, these robes were finally not given to the bhikkhunī sangha. 
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you, when a householder wants to give robes to the bhikkhunī sangha, obstruct them and make them not give?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked Thullanandā bhikkhunī: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you, when a householder wants to give robes to the bhikkhunī sangha, obstruct them and make them not give?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī prevents someone from giving robes to the sangha, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼遮與僧衣，波夜提。隨遮，隨得波夜提。(一百三十四事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī prevents someone from giving robes to the sangha, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she prevents it, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 134.)
