<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時舍衛國有一大臣，淨潔自喜好出他過。語其婦言：「諸比丘尼不淨著弊棄衣，莫聽坐我床上。」婦答言：「爾。」言已便去。偷蘭難陀常入出是家，中前著衣持鉢往到其家，居士婦言：「我丈夫淨潔自喜好出他過，是語我言：『諸比丘尼不淨著弊棄衣，莫聽坐我床上。』」偷蘭難陀比丘尼即便瞋言：「速去！汝等姓勝我耶？家勝我耶？若我不作比丘尼者，汝等當供給我。」即高褰衣坐其床上。諸居士呵責言：「諸比丘尼自言：『善好有功德。』不問主人輒坐他床上，如王夫人、如大臣婦。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, a high official in Sāvatthī was cleanly and loved to point out other’s faults. He said to his wife: “These bhikkhunīs are unclean and wear rag robes. Don’t allow them to sit on my bed.” The wife answered: “Okay.” When they had said this, he left. Thullanandā often went in and out of this house. Before midday, she put on her robe, took her bowl, and went to this house. The lady of the house said: “My husband is cleanly and loves to point out other’s faults. He said to me: ‘These bhikkhunīs are unclean and wear rag robes. Don’t allow them to sit on my bed.’” Thullanandā bhikkhunī then said angrily: “Leave quickly! Is your clan superior to mine? Is your family superior to mine? If I hadn’t become a bhikkhunī, you’d have served me.” Then she hitched up her robe, and sat on his bed. The householders criticized her: “These bhikkhunīs say of themselves: ‘We’re virtuous and have merit’, but they just sit on the owner’s bed without asking, like queens and wives of high officials.”

<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問偷蘭難陀比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，不問主人坐他床上？」種種呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼，不問主人坐他床上，波夜提。」</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked Thullanandā bhikkhunī: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you sit on someone’s bed without asking the owner?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī sits on someone’s bed without asking the owner, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼，不問主人坐他床上，波夜提。隨不問坐，隨得波夜提。(一百四十四事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī sits on someone’s bed without asking the owner, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she sits without asking, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 144.)
