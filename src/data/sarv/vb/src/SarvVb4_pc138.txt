<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時比丘尼僧打揵搥和合欲斷事，優婆和比丘尼不往，遣使喚言：「僧已和合欲斷事，汝來。」答言：「汝遠去！我思惟是事，非法不正，隨愛、隨瞋、隨怖、隨癡，是故不去。」以是因緣故，僧不成斷事。</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, the bhikkhunī sangha struck the bell wanting to settle matters in harmony. Upavānā(?) bhikkhunī didn’t go, and they sent a messenger to summon her: “The sangha is in harmony and wants to settle matters. You should come!” She answered: “You should return. I think this matter is against the dhamma, it’s incorrect, and they follow greed, hatred, fear, and delusion. Therefore I won’t go.” For this reason the sangha was unable to settle matters.

<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，僧斷事不隨順？」種種呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問優婆和比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責：「云何名比丘尼，僧斷事不隨順？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼，僧斷事時不隨順者，波夜提。」</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you don’t go along with the sangha settling matters?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked Upavānā bhikkhunī: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you don’t go along with the sangha settling matters?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī, when the sangha is settling matters, doesn’t go along with it, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼，僧斷事時不隨順者，波夜提。隨不隨順，隨得波夜提。(一百三十八事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī, when the sangha is settling matters, doesn’t go along with it, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she doesn’t go along, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 138.)
