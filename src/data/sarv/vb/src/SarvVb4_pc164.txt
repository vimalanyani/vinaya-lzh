<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在王舍城。爾時助調達比丘尼，以好香揩身，復以塗香、胡麻屑、胡麻滓揩身。</lzh>
The Buddha was in Rājagaha. At that time, the bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta rubbed good perfume on their bodies, and also rubbed mud perfume, ground sesame, and sesame dregs on their bodies.

<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，以香揩身，以塗香、胡麻屑、胡麻滓揩身？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問助調達比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責：「云何名比丘尼，以塗香、胡麻屑、胡麻滓揩身？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼，以塗香、胡麻屑、胡麻滓揩身，波夜提。」</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you rub perfume on your bodies, and rub mud perfume, ground sesame, and sesame dregs on your bodies?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked the bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta: “Did you really do this?” They answered: “We really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you rub mud perfume, ground sesame, and sesame dregs on your bodies?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī rubs mud perfume, ground sesame, and sesame dregs on her body, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼以香揩身，波夜提。若以塗香、胡麻屑、胡麻滓揩身，皆波夜提。隨用揩身，隨得爾所波夜提。(一百六十四事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī rubs perfume on her body, it’s a pācittiya. If she rubs mud perfume, ground sesame, or sesame dregs on her body, all are pācittiyas. Whenever she uses them and rubs them on her body, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 164.)
