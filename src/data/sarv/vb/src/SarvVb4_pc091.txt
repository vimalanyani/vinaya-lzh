<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在王舍城。爾時助調達比丘尼入白衣舍，獨與白衣男子共立共語竊語，遣共行比丘尼去，求閑便故。是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，入白衣舍，獨與一白衣男子共立共語共竊語，遣共行比丘尼去？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問是比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，入白衣舍，獨與一白衣男子共立共語共竊語，遣共行比丘尼去？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼入白衣舍，獨與一白衣男子共立共語竊語，遣共行比丘尼去，求獨語故，波夜提。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Rājagaha. At that time, a bhikkhunī supporting Devadatta entered a lay house, stood and secretly talked together with a lay man alone, and sent the bhikkhunī who had come with her away, because she was seeking an opportunity for privacy. 

Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you enter a lay house, stand and secretly talk together with one lay man alone, and send the bhikkhunī who came with you away?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked that bhikkhunī: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you enter a lay house, stand and secretly talk together with one lay man alone, and send the bhikkhunī who came with you away?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī enters a lay house, and stands and secretly talks together with one lay man alone, and sends the bhikkhunī who came with her away, because she seeks to talk alone, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼入白衣舍，獨與一男子共立，突吉羅；共語，突吉羅；共竊語，突吉羅。求獨語故，遣共行比丘尼離聞處去，波夜提。不離聞處，突吉羅。(九十一事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī enters a lay house, and stands together with one man alone, it’s a dukkaṭa. If they talk together, it’s a dukkaṭa. If they secretly talk together, it’s a dukkaṭa. If, because she seeks to talk alone, she sends the bhikkhunī who came with her out of earshot, it’s a pācittiya. If she’s not out of earshot, it’s a dukkaṭa. (End of rule 91.)
