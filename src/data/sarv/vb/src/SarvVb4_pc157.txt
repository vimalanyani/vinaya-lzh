<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在迦維羅衛國。爾時摩訶男釋，請佛及二部僧明日食，佛默然受。知佛默然受已，頭面禮足右遶而去，還家通夜辦種種多美飲食。早起敷坐處，遣使白佛：「時到，食具已辦，唯聖知時。」佛與二部僧入已皆坐。知佛坐已，自手行水，自與種種多美飲食，自恣滿足。爾時助調達比丘尼，滿鉢中飯以羹澆上，在前不噉四向顧視。摩訶男釋作是念：「我當遍看誰少、誰不少？誰食、誰不食？」見助調達比丘尼滿鉢飯羹在前不食，語言：「善女！何故不食？」答言：「我先已食，何故取飯？」答言：「汝便持去。」摩訶男釋善好不嫌，諸居士隨摩訶男釋者作是言：「摩訶男釋供給眾僧如事大家，諸比丘尼現前呵辱。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Kapilavatthu. At that time, Mahānāma the Sakyan invited the Buddha and both sanghas for the next day’s meal. The Buddha accepted in silence. Having understood that the Buddha had accepted in silence, (Mahānāma) paid respect with his head at (the Buddha’s) feet, circumambulated him on the right side, and left. He returned to his home and prepared all kinds of delicious foods and drinks the whole night. He got up early, laid out seats, and sent a messenger to tell the Buddha: “The time has come, the food is fully prepared. May the Noble One know (it’s the right) time.” The Buddha and both sanghas entered and all sat down. When (Mahānāma) knew that the Buddha was seated, he brought water with his own hands, himself gave all kinds of delicious foods and drinks, and invited them until they were satisfied. At that time, the bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta had full bowls of rice in front of them, with curries sprinkled on top, but they weren’t eating, and were looking around. Mahānāma the Sakyan thought: “I’ll have a look everywhere who has little, who has much, who is eating, and who isn’t eating.” He saw the bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta with bowls full of rice and curries in front of them but not eating, and said: “Good women, why aren’t you eating?” They answered: “We’ve already eaten earlier. Why would we take more food?” He answered: “Then take it away.” Mahānāma the Sakyan was virtuous and not upset, but the householders following him said: “Mahānāma the Sakyan supports the sangha as though serving a high-ranking person, but the bhikkhunīs show disdain.”

<lzh>佛遙見比丘尼所作，聞諸居士呵責，食後到僧坊中集二部僧，種種因緣呵責助調達比丘尼：「摩訶男釋供給眾僧如事大家，云何現前毀辱？」種種因緣呵責已，語諸比丘：「從今聽諸比丘尼數數食。何以故？女人喜數數食故。以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼，受請都不食者，波夜提。」</lzh>
The Buddha saw from a distance what the bhikkhunīs were doing, and heard the criticism of the householders. After the meal, he went to the monastery, gathered both sanghas, and criticized the bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta with all kinds of reasons: “Mahānāma the Sakyan supports the sangha as though serving a high-ranking person. Why did you show disdain?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “From now on, I allow the bhikkhunīs eat several times. Why? Because women like to eat several times. For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī accepts an invitation and doesn’t eat anything, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼受請，乃至不食一口，波夜提。隨受請不食，隨得爾所波夜提。(一百五十七事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī accepts an invitation and doesn’t even eat one mouthful, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she accepts an invitation and doesn’t eat, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 157.)
