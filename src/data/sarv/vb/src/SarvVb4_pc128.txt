<h2>First Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時舍衛城諸居士婦，向阿耆羅河洗浴。先有比丘尼，裸形河中洗浴，諸居士婦呵責言：「不吉弊女，麁身大腹垂乳，何用作比丘尼為？何不反戒作婢？」是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，以是事向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問是比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，裸形露處洗？」種種因緣呵責已語諸比丘：「從今聽比丘尼畜浴衣著露地洗。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, female householders of Sāvatthī went to the river Aciravatī to bathe. There was already a bhikkhunī who was bathing naked in the river. The female householders criticized her: “Inauspicious, inferior woman with your coarse body, big belly, and drooping breasts, what’s the use of your being a bhikkhunī? Why don’t you disrobe and become a slave?” 

Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked that bhikkhunī: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you bathe naked outdoors?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: 


<h2>Preliminary Ruling</h2>

“From now on, I allow that a bhikkhunī keeps a bathing robe, and wears it when bathing outdoors.”


<h2>Second Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>爾時諸比丘尼，知佛聽畜浴衣，便廣長作。是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責：「云何名比丘尼，知佛聽畜浴衣，便廣長大作？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問諸比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，知我聽畜浴衣，便廣長大作？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼欲作浴衣，當應量作。量者，長五修伽陀搩手、廣二搩手半。過是作者，波夜提。」</lzh>
When the bhikkhunīs learned that the Buddha had allowed to keep a bathing robe, they made it wide and long. 

Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you, after learning that the Buddha allowed to keep a bathing robe, make it wide, long, and large?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked those bhikkhunīs: “Did you really do this?” They answered: “We really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you, after learning that I allowed to keep a bathing robe, make it wide, long, and large?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī wants to make a bathing robe, she should make it to the measurements. “The measurements” means five sugata handspans in length, two and a half handspans in width. If she makes it larger, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼欲作浴衣，若過長量、不過廣量，波夜提。若過廣量、不過長量，波夜提。隨過長廣量，隨得波夜提。(一百二十八事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī wants to make a bathing robe, and if she makes it longer than the measurements, but not wider than the measurements, it’s a pācittiya. If she makes it wider than the measurements, but not longer than the measurements, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she makes it longer or wider than the measurements, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 128.)
