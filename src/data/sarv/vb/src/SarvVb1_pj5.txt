<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時舍衛國中王園精舍，有比丘尼名周那難陀，年少端正。有鹿子居士兒，亦年少端正。是男子於周那難陀比丘尼深生漏心，是比丘尼於是男子亦生漏心。是鹿子兒如是思惟：「若我語是比丘尼作是事者，身自得罪，王當治我，惡名流布四方，身壞命終當墮地獄。」比丘尼亦如是思惟：「若我語是男子作是事者，身自得罪，而令他得罪，惡名流布四方，諸比丘、比丘尼以法治我，諸天善神不復守護我，身壞命終當墮地獄。」是比丘尼常憶念是男子，不得從意故，生病羸瘦在房內臥，斷威儀不能行來。</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, there was a bhikkhunī named Sundarinandā in Sāvatthī in the monastery in the king’s park, who who was young and attractive. There was also the householder Migāraputta’s son, who was also young and attractive. Profound defilements arose in the mind of that man with regards to Sundarinandā bhikkhunī, and defilements also arose in the mind of the bhikkhunī with regards to that man. That Migāraputta’s son thought: “If I speak with this bhikkhunī about doing that thing, I myself will commit an offense. The king will punish me, a bad reputation will spread in all directions, and when the body breaks up and my life comes to an end, I’ll fall into hell.” The bhikkhunī also thought: “If I speak with this man about doing that thing, I myself will commit an offense, and I’ll make him commit an offense. A bad reputation will spread in all directions, the bhikkhus and bhikkhunīs will punish me according to dhamma, the gods and virtuous spirits will no longer protect me, and when the body breaks up and my life comes to an end, I’ll fall into hell.” That bhikkhunī often thought about that man, and because she couldn’t fulfill her wish, she became sick, weak, and feeble, and lay down in her room. She abandoned proper conduct, and couldn’t get up anymore. 
<lzh>是男子聞是比丘尼得病受苦惱，在房內臥不能行來，聞已作是念：「是比丘尼更無有病，但以念我故，致是羸瘦受諸苦惱，我何不往是比丘尼所，不說是事亦能除病。」作是念已，即往王園比丘尼精舍，到已問諸比丘尼言：「周那難陀比丘尼為在何處？」答言：「在某房內病臥受苦惱，斷威儀不能行來。」是男子即往到比丘尼房中，摩觸抱捉作是言：「汝病小差不？可忍不？苦惱不增長耶？」答言：「病不差、不可忍，苦惱增長。」爾時比丘尼口出惡不淨語，作是言：「此是我分，他不愛念我，我便愛念他。」</lzh>
That man heard that the bhikkhunī had fallen sick and was suffering, that she had lain down in her room and couldn’t get up. Having heard this, he thought: “That bhikkhunī isn’t sick, but because of thinking of me, she’s feeling weak and feeble, and going through this suffering. Why don’t I go to that bhikkhunī? Without speaking about that thing, she’ll recover from the sickness.” Having thought that, he went to the bhikkhunī monastery in the king’s park. On arrival, he asked the bhikkhunīs: “Where is Sundarinandā bhikkhunī?” They answered: “She’s in such-and-such a room, sick, lying down, and suffering, declining in proper conduct, and unable to get up.” That man then went into the bhikkhunī’s room, touched and embraced her, and said: “Is your illness getting a little better, can you tolerate it, is the suffering not increasing?” She answered: “The illness isn’t getting better, I can’t tolerate it, and the suffering is increasing.” Then unwholesome, impure words came out of the bhikkhunī’s mouth, and she said: “This is my lot: Someone doesn’t love me, but I still love him.” 

<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，有漏心聽漏心男子摩觸抱捉？」種種因緣呵已向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，佛知故問周那難陀比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責：「云何名比丘尼，有漏心聽漏心男子摩觸抱捉？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒：攝僧故、僧極好攝故、僧安樂住故、折伏高心人故、有慚愧者得安樂故、不信者得淨信故、已信者增長信故、遮今世惱漏故、斷後世惡趣故、梵行久住故。從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized her: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you, with a defiled mind, allow a man with a defiled mind to touch and embrace you?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. The Buddha knew, and intentionally asked Sundarinandā bhikkhunī: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you, with a defiled mind, allow a man with a defiled mind to touch and embrace you?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs: For the preservation of the sangha, for the preservation of the excellence of the sangha, for the sangha to abide in peace and happiness, for the subduing of conceited persons, for the peace and happiness of conscientious persons, for the unfaithful to attain pure faith, for the faithful to increase in faith, for the restraint of the defilements in this life, for the obstruction of bad destinations after death, and for the long continuance of the monastic life. From now on, this precept should be recited thus:


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>若比丘尼有漏心，聽漏心男子髮際以下至腕膝以上却衣，順摩、逆摩、牽推、按掐、抱上、抱下，是比丘尼得波羅夷不共住。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī with a defiled mind allows a man with a defiled mind, having removed her robes, to rub her up and down below the hairline and above the wrists and the knees, to pull, push, press, and pinch her, to lift her up and set her down, that bhikkhunī incurs a pārājika, and doesn’t live in community.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>漏心者，於是人邊生愛結深厚，男子漏心亦如是。</lzh>
“A defiled mind” means, when she’s close to that person, a strong fetter of desire arises. Likewise for “a man with a defiled mind”.

<lzh>男者，謂人男，能作婬事。</lzh>
“A man” means a human man who can engage in sexual intercourse.

<lzh>波羅夷者，是罪弊惡深重，退墮不如，是故名波羅夷。</lzh>
“A pārājika” means this offense is low, evil, deep, grave, and an unequalled fall. Therefore it’s called “pārājika”.

<lzh>不共住者，諸比丘尼，不與此比丘尼共作法事，謂白羯磨、白二羯磨、白四羯磨、說戒、自恣、作十三比丘尼羯磨。</lzh>
“Not living in community” means that the bhikkhunīs don’t engage in matters of dhamma with this bhikkhunī, that’s to say formal acts with a motion, formal acts with a motion as second, formal acts with a motion as fourth, the recitation of the precepts, the invitation ceremony, or performing the 13 formal acts for bhikkhunīs. 

<lzh>是中犯者，有八種：</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: There are eight kinds:<note> It’s not fully clear how to divide the following section to arrive at eight permutations. The numbers are my best guess.</note> 

<lzh>若比丘尼生漏心，聽漏心男子却衣順摩面，犯波羅夷。
若摩咽、若胸脇、脊、腹臍、大小便處、髀乃至膝，如順摩，逆摩、牽推、按掐亦如是。
髮際以上、腕以前、膝以下，却衣摩觸，偷蘭遮。</lzh>
1) If a defiled mind arises in a bhikkhunī and she allows a man with a defiled mind, having removed her robes, to rub her face, she commits a pārājika.
Likewise if he rubs her throat, chest, flanks, back, belly, belly button, the area of the anus and the vagina, or her thighs down to the knees, and if he rubs her up and down, pulls, pushes, presses, and pinches her. 

2) If he touches her above the hairline, in front of the wrists, or below the knees, having removed her robes, it’s a thullaccaya.

<lzh>若比丘尼有漏心，聽漏心男子却衣，從地抱著机上，波羅夷。
從机上著獨坐床上，從獨坐床上著大床上、從大床上著輿上、從輿上著車上、從車上著馬上、從馬上著象上、從象上著堂上，皆波羅夷。</lzh>
3) If a bhikkhunī with a defiled mind allows a man with a defiled mind, having removed her robes, to lift her up from the ground and place her onto a desk, it’s a pārājika. If from the desk he places her onto a single seat, from a single seat onto a large bed, from a large bed onto a palanquin, from a palanquin onto a carriage, from a carriage onto a horse, from a horse onto an elephant, or from an elephant onto a hall, all are pārājikas.

4) If she allows him to lift her up and set her down (by touching her) above the hairline, in front of the wrists, or below the knees, having removed her robes, it’s a thullaccaya.

<lzh>若比丘尼有漏心，聽漏心男子合衣順摩面，偷蘭遮。</lzh>
5) If a bhikkhunī with a defiled mind allows a man with a defiled mind to rub her face while fully clothed, it’s a thullaccaya.
<lzh>若咽若胸脇、脊、腹臍、大小便處、髀膝，得偷蘭遮。
如順摩，逆摩、牽推、按掐亦如是。
合衣摩觸髮際以上、腕以前、膝以下，突吉羅。</lzh>

6) If he touches her above the hairline, in front of the wrists, or below the knees, while fully clothed, it’s a dukkaṭa.

若髮際以上、腕以前、膝以下，聽合衣抱舉上下，突吉羅。</lzh>

8) If she allows him to lift her up and set her down (by touching her) above the hairline, in front of the wrists, or below the knees, while fully clothed, it’s a dukkaṭa.

<lzh>不犯者，若父想、兄弟想、兒子想、若水漂、若火燒、若刀矟、弓杖、若欲墮坑、若值惡獸難、惡鬼難，不犯。一切無著心，不犯。(五事竟)</lzh>
There’s no offense: If she perceives him as her father, her brother, or her son, if she’s washed away by water, if she’s burnt by fire, if (he holds) a knife, lance, bow, or staff, if she’s about to fall into a chasm, or if she encounters difficulties by a savage animal or demon, the offense isn’t committed. And in all cases where she has a mind free from attachments, the offense isn’t committed. (End of rule 5.)
