<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時偷蘭難陀比丘尼，使人剃大小便處毛。諸比丘尼問言：「汝作何等？」答言：「剃大小便處毛，為好故。」是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，使人剃大小便處毛？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問偷蘭難陀：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，使人剃大小便處毛？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, Thullanandā bhikkhunī had someone shave the hair around her anus and her vagina. The bhikkhunīs asked her: “What are you doing?” She answered: “Shaving the hair around the anus and the vagina, to look good.” 

Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you have someone shave the hair around the anus and the vagina?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked Thullanandā: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you have someone shave the hair around the anus and the vagina?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus:


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>若比丘尼剃大小便處毛，波夜提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī shaves the hair around the anus and the vagina, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼剃大便處、毛波夜提。剃小便處毛，波夜提。除二處，剃餘處毛，突吉羅。(七十三事竟) </lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī shaves the hair around the anus, it’s a pācittiya. If she shaves the hair around the vagina, it’s a pācittiya. If she shaves the hair in any other place except for these two, it’s a dukkaṭa. (End of rule 73.)
