<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時比丘尼僧，打揵搥和合欲分衣。優婆和比丘尼作僧斷事人，不往僧中，遣使喚言：「僧已和合欲分衣，汝來！」答言：「不往，汝遠去。是事非法不正邪事，隨欲、隨瞋、隨怖、隨癡。我是僧斷事人，云何離我分衣？是故不去。」以是因緣故，僧不得分衣。</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, the bhikkhunī sangha struck the bell wanting to distribute cloth in harmony. Upavānā(?) bhikkhunī acted as the sangha official for settling matters, and she didn’t go to the sangha. They sent a messenger to summon her: “The sangha is in harmony and wants to distribute cloth. You should come!” She answered: “I won’t go. You should return. This matter is against the dhamma, it’s incorrect and wrong, and they follow greed, hatred, fear, and delusion. I’m this sangha’s official for settling matters. Why do they distribute cloth without me? Therefore I won’t go.” For this reason the sangha was unable to distribute cloth.

<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責：「云何名比丘尼，僧分衣不隨順？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問優婆和比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，僧分衣不隨順？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼，僧分衣時不隨者，波夜提。」</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you don’t go along with the sangha distributing cloth?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked Upavānā bhikkhunī: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you don’t go along with the sangha distributing cloth?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī, when the sangha is distributing cloth, doesn’t go along with it, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼，僧分衣時不隨者，波夜提。隨不隨，隨得波夜提。(一百三十七事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī, when the sangha is distributing cloth, doesn’t go along with it, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she doesn’t go along, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 137.)
