<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時偷蘭難陀比丘尼，畜有男女自隨女人為眾。是比丘尼中前著衣持鉢，男女前後圍遶共行乞食。諸居士共相謂言：「汝知不？諸沙門釋子作婬欲人，共比丘尼僧坊中生兒女。」是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，畜將男女自隨女人為眾？」種種因緣呵責已向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問偷蘭難陀比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責：「云何名比丘尼，畜將男女自隨女人為眾？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼，畜有男女自隨女人為眾，波逸提。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, Thullanandā bhikkhunī took on a woman as her student who had a following of men and women. That bhikkhunī, before midday, put on her robes, took her bowl, and went on almsround, surrounded by the men and women. The householders said to each other: “Did you know that those renunciates that are Sakyan children work as prostitutes? In the bhikkhunī monastery, they give birth to children.” 

Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you take on a woman as your student who is followed by men and women?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked Thullanandā bhikkhunī: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you take on a woman as your student who is followed by men and women?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī takes on a woman as her student who has a following of men and women, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波逸提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼畜有男女自隨女人為眾，波逸提。隨畜，隨得爾所波逸提。(一百一十九事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī takes on a woman as her student who has a following of men and women, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she takes one on, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 119.)
