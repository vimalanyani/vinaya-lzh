<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在王舍城。爾時助調達比丘尼，自為身故乞金銀。諸居士問言：「汝出家人用金銀為？汝比丘尼法，政應乞羹飯、燈燭、薪草。」諸比丘尼言：「汝等居士無所知，若乞飲食、燈燭、薪草者，乞名雖多所得利少。若乞金銀者，乞名少所得利多。」諸居士瞋呵責言：「諸比丘尼自言：『善好有功德。』自為乞金銀，如王夫人、大臣婦。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Rājagaha. At that time, the bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta asked for gold and silver for themselves. The householders asked: “What do you renunciates use money for? According to your bhikkhunī rules, you should ask for rice and curries, lamps, candles, firewood, and grass.” The bhikkhunīs said: “You householders don’t know anything. If we ask for drinks, food, lamps, candles, firewood, and grass, these requests are called ‘even though much is obtained, the merit is small’. If we ask for gold and silver, these requests are called ‘little is obtained, but the merit is large.’” The householders angrily criticized them: “These bhikkhunīs say of themselves: ‘We’re virtuous and have merit’, but they ask for gold and silver for themselves, like queens and wives of high officials.”

<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，從居士自為乞金銀？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問助調達比丘尼言：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，自為身乞金銀？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼自為身乞金銀者，尼薩耆波夜提。」</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you ask for gold and silver from householders for yourselves?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked the bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta: “Did you really do this?” They answered: “We really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you ask for gold and silver for yourselves?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī asks for gold and silver for herself, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>尼薩耆波夜提者，是金銀應捨，波夜提罪應悔過。</lzh>
“A nissaggiya pācittiya” means that this gold and silver should be relinquished, and the pācittiya offense should be confessed.

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼自為乞金銀，得尼薩耆波夜提。隨乞，隨得爾所尼薩耆波夜提。若為佛圖乞、若為僧乞、若不乞自與，不犯。(第二十四事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī asks for gold and silver for herself, she incurs a nissaggiya pācittiya. Whenever she asks, she incurs a nissaggiya pācittiya. If she asks for the Buddha, or for the sangha, or if someone gives on their own without her asking, the offense isn’t committed. (End of rule 24.)
