<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時偷蘭難陀比丘尼，歲歲度弟子，語諸弟子言：「我所入處，汝等皆隨我入。若我有所得者，汝亦當得。」偷蘭難陀比丘尼，一時著衣持鉢行乞食，入一家得滿鉢去。次弟子入，又得滿鉢去。第二、第三亦復次入。居士不能復與，即閉門作是言：「誰能與是諸不吉比丘尼食？」是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責偷蘭難陀比丘尼：「云何名比丘尼，歲歲度弟子？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼歲歲度弟子者，波夜提。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, Thullanandā bhikkhunī ordained students every year. She said to the students: “Whatever places I enter, you all enter behind me. If I receive anything, you’ll also receive it.” One time, Thullanandā bhikkhunī put on her robes, took her bowl, and went on almsround. She entered a house, received a full bowl, and left. The next student entered, also received a full bowl, and left. The second and third students also entered in order. The householders couldn’t give again. Then they closed the gate and said: “Who can give food to those unauspicious bhikkhunīs?” 

Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked her: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized Thullanandā bhikkhunī with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you ordain students every year?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī ordains students every year, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼歲歲度弟子者，波夜提。隨歲歲度，隨得波夜提。</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī ordains students every year, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she ordains every year, she incurs a pācittiya. 

<lzh>不犯者，若隔歲度一、若度二者，不犯。(一百二十六事竟)</lzh>
There’s no offense: If she ordains one or two every other year, the offense isn’t committed. (End of rule 126.)
