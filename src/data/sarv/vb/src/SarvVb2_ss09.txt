<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在俱舍彌國。爾時長老車匿母作比丘尼，名憂婆和。妹作比丘尼，名闡提。闡提為人惡性，作不善行，常惱諸比丘尼。諸比丘尼欲為闡提作擯羯磨，是憂婆和是眾僧斷事人，於僧中遮不得作羯磨。有時憂婆和餘行不在，諸比丘尼言：「我等今與闡提比丘尼作擯羯磨。」有比丘尼言：「憂婆和或能中間遮。」更有比丘尼言：「憂婆和已餘處去，多知識，卒未得還。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Kosambī. At that time, the venerable Channa’s mother became a bhikkhunī called Upava(nā)(?). Her younger sister became a bhikkhunī called Chandī(?). Chandī had a bad character towards people, engaged in unvirtuous conduct, and always annoyed the other bhikkhunīs. The bhikkhunīs wanted to carry out a formal act of expulsion against Chandī. Upavanā was the sangha offical for settling matters, and blocked it in the sangha, so they weren’t able to carry out the formal act. There was a time when Upavanā went somewhere else and wasn’t there, and the bhikkhunīs said: “Let’s now carry out a formal act of expulsion against Chandī bhikkhunī.” Some bhikkhunīs said: “Upavanā might be able to block it midway.” And other bhikkhunīs said: “Upavanā has gone to another place where she has many friends. She won’t be able to return quickly.”
<lzh>諸比丘尼即打揵搥集尼僧，與闡提作擯羯磨。明日眾人聞闡提比丘尼被擯，憂婆和比丘尼還到其妹所，共相問訊。闡提言：「莫共我語。」問言：「何故？」答言：「諸比丘尼羯磨擯我。」憂婆和念言：「是事不是，我作僧斷事人不在便強作擯，今我不能問諸比丘尼不取欲，出界外當與解擯。」時憂婆和不問諸比丘尼不取欲，即出界外為闡提解擯。</lzh>
The bhikkhunīs then struck the bell to gather the bhikkhunī sangha, and carried out a formal act of expulsion against Chandī. The next day, many people heard that Chandī bhikkhunī had been expelled. Upavanā bhikkhunī returned to her younger sister and they greeted each other. Chandī said: “Don’t talk to me.” She asked: “Why?” She answered: “The bhikkhunīs did a formal act to expel me.” Upavanā thought: “This matter is inacceptable. I’m the sangha offical for settling matters, and when I’m not here, they forcefully carry out an expulsion. Now I’m unable to ask the bhikkhunīs, and won’t obtain their consent, but I’ll leave the territory and release her from the expulsion.” Then Upavanā didn’t ask the bhikkhunīs, didn’t obtain consent, and left the territory to release Chandī from the expulsion.

<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責：「云何名比丘尼，知尼僧如法和合作羯磨擯比丘尼，不問比丘尼僧，不取諸比丘尼欲，出界外與他解擯？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問憂婆和比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責：「云何名比丘尼，知比丘尼僧如法作擯，不問比丘尼僧，亦不取欲，出界外與比丘尼解擯？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼，知比丘尼一心和合僧作不見擯，不問比丘尼僧，亦不取欲，出界外與他解擯，是法初犯僧伽婆尸沙可悔過。」</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you know that the harmonious bhikkhunī sangha carried out a formal act according to dhamma to expel a bhikkhunī, and without asking the bhikkhunī sangha, without obtaining the bhikkhunīs’ consent, you leave the territory to release her from the expulsion?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked Upavanā bhikkhunī: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you know that the bhikkhunī sangha carried out an expulsion according to dhamma, and without asking the bhikkhunī sangha, without obtaining their consent, you leave the territory to release the bhikkhunī from the expulsion?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī knows that the harmonious bhikkhunī sangha unanimously carried out an expulsion for not seeing (an offense), and without asking the bhikkhunī sangha, without obtaining their consent, she leaves the territory to release her from the expulsion, that act is an immediate saṅghādisesa, from which one can repent.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>知者，若自知、若從他聞、若彼自說。</lzh>
“Knowing” means she either knows herself, or hears it from others, or the (expelled bhikkhunī) tells her herself.

<lzh>如法者，如法、如毘尼、如佛教擯。</lzh>
“According to dhamma” means an expulsion according to dhamma, according to vinaya, according to the Buddha’s instruction.

<lzh>不問比丘尼僧者，不以是事白比丘尼僧。</lzh>
“Without asking the bhikkhunī sangha” means without speaking to the bhikkhunī sangha about this matter.

<lzh>不取欲者，乃至不取四人欲。</lzh>
“Without obtaining consent” means not even obtaining four people’s consent.

<lzh>出界外者，眾僧籬外、壁外、障外。</lzh>
“Leaving the territory” means outside the sangha’s fence, wall, or partition.

<lzh>解擯者，若自解、若使他令解。</lzh>
“Releasing from the expulsion” means she releases her herself, or has others release her.

<lzh>僧伽婆尸沙者，是罪屬僧，僧中有殘，因僧前悔過除滅，是名僧伽婆尸沙。</lzh>
“A saṅghādisesa” means this offense is dependent upon the sangha, and in the sangha there’s a remainder. Because she confesses and clears it in front of the sangha, therefore it’s called a saṅghādisesa. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若和上尼知、作羯磨人知、僧知，和上尼犯僧伽婆尸沙，羯磨人犯偷蘭遮，僧犯突吉羅。若和上尼知、羯磨人知，僧不知，和上尼犯僧伽婆尸沙，羯磨人犯偷蘭遮，僧不犯。若和上尼知，羯磨人不知、僧不知，和上尼犯僧伽婆尸沙，羯磨人及僧不犯。若一切不知，不犯。(第九事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If the preceptor<note> I’m not sure why the rule mentions a preceptor, since it isn’t about ordination. It might refer to the most senior bhikkhunī, or just be a mistake.</note> knows, the master of ceremony knows, and the sangha knows, the preceptor commits a saṅghādisesa, the master of ceremony commits a thullaccaya, and the sangha commits a dukkaṭa. If the preceptor knows, the master of ceremony knows, but the sangha doesn’t know, the preceptor commits a saṅghādisesa, the master of ceremony commits a thullaccaya, and the sangha doesn’t commit an offense. If the preceptor knows, but the master of ceremony doesn’t know, and the sangha doesn’t know, the preceptor commits a saṅghādisesa, and the master of ceremony and the sangha don’t commit an offense. If they all don’t know, the offense isn’t committed. (End of rule 9.)
