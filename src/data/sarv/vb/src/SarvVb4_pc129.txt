<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在王舍城。爾時有助調達比丘尼，數數易衣服。是時有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責：「云何名比丘尼，數數易衣服？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問助調達比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責：「云何名比丘尼，數數易衣服？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒，從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼數數易衣服，波夜提。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Rājagaha. At that time, the bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta often changed their robes. 

Then there were bhikkhunīs of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you often change robes?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked the bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta: “Did you really do this?” They answered: “We really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you often change robes?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī often changes robes, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼數數易衣服，波逸提。隨易，隨得波逸提。(一百二十九事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī often changes robes, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she changes them, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 129.)
