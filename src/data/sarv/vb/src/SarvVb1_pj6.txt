<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在王舍城。爾時助調達比丘尼，聽六群比丘捉手、捉衣、共立、共語、共期，入屏覆處待男子來舉身如白衣女。</lzh>
The Buddha was in Rājagaha. At that time, the bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta allowed the group-of-six bhikkhus to hold their hands, to hold their robes, and they stood together, talked together, made appointments, entered secluded places, waited for the men to come, and moved their bodies like lay women.

<lzh>爾時有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣訶責言：「云何名比丘尼有漏心，聽漏心男子捉手、捉衣、共立、共語、共期，入屏覆處待男子來舉身如白衣女？」種種因緣訶已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問助調達比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責：「云何名比丘尼有漏心，聽漏心男子捉手、捉衣、共立、共語、共期，入屏覆處待男子來舉身如白衣女？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼有漏心，聽漏心男子捉手、捉衣、共立、共語、共期，入屏覆處待男子來舉身如白衣女，以是八事示貪著相，是比丘尼犯波羅夷不應共住。」</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you, with a defiled mind, allow a man with a defiled mind to hold your hand, hold your robes, stand together, talk together, make an appointment, enter a secluded place, wait for the man to come, and move your body like lay women?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked the bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta: “Did you really do this?” They answered: “We really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you, with a defiled mind, allow a man with a defiled mind to hold your hand, hold your robes, stand together, talk together, make an appointment, enter a secluded place, wait for the man to come, and move your body like lay women?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī with a defiled mind allows a man with a defiled mind to hold her hand, hold her robes, stands together, talks together, makes an appointment, enters a secluded place, waits for the man to come, and moves her body, like a lay woman, if by these eight things, she shows the signs of craving and attachment, that bhikkhunī commits a pārājika, and shouldn’t live in community.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>漏心者，於是人邊生愛結深厚，男子漏心亦如是。</lzh>
“A defiled mind” means, when she’s close to that person, a strong fetter of desire arises. Likewise for “a man with a defiled mind”.

<lzh>男子者，謂人男，能作婬事。</lzh>
“A man” means a human man who can engage in sexual intercourse.

<lzh>捉手者，從腕前，名為手。</lzh>
“Holding her hand” means what is in front of the wrists is called “the hand”.

<lzh>捉衣者，捉襯身衣。</lzh>
“Holding her robes” means holding the robes on her body.

<lzh>共立者，可說不淨語處。</lzh>
“Standing together” means in a place where they can speak impure words.

<lzh>共語者，可說不淨語處。</lzh>
“Talking together” means in a place where they can speak impure words.

<lzh>共期者，可作惡處。</lzh>
“Making an appointment” means in a place where they can do bad things.

<lzh>入屏覆處者，若壁覆障、草席覆障、衣幔覆障處。</lzh>
“Entering a secluded place” means a place hidden by a wall, hidden by a straw-mat screen, or hidden by a cloth curtain.

<lzh>待男子來者，可作惡處。</lzh>
“Waiting for the man to come” means in a place where they can to bad things.

<lzh>舉身如白衣女者，若捉、若抱，不逆男子意，如白衣女。</lzh>
“Moving her body like a lay woman” means holding or embracing, not opposing the man’s will, like a lay woman.

<lzh>用是八事示貪著相犯波羅夷。</lzh>
If she, through these eight things, shows the signs of craving and attachment, she commits a pārājika.

<lzh>波羅夷者，是罪弊惡深重，退墮不如。若比丘尼犯是罪者，不名沙門尼、非釋女，失比丘尼法。</lzh>
“A pārājika” means this offense is low, evil, deep, grave, and an unequalled fall. If a bhikkhunī commits this offense, she’s not called a renunciate, not a Sakyan daughter, and has lost her status as a bhikkhunī.

<lzh>不共住者，諸比丘尼不共作法事，謂白羯磨、白二羯磨、白四羯磨、說戒、自恣、立十三比丘尼羯磨。</lzh>
“Not living in community” means that the bhikkhunīs don’t engage in matters of dhamma with her, that’s to say formal acts with a motion, formal acts with a motion as second, formal acts with a motion as fourth, the recitation of the precepts, the invitation ceremony, or performing the 13 formal acts for bhikkhunīs. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼有漏心，聽漏心男子捉手，偷蘭遮。聽捉衣，偷蘭遮。若共立，偷蘭遮。若共語，偷蘭遮。若共期，偷蘭遮。若入屏覆處，偷蘭遮。待男子來，偷蘭遮。身與男子如白衣女，偷蘭遮。若具作八事，犯波羅夷。(六事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī with a defiled mind allows a man with a defiled mind to hold her hand, it’s a thullaccaya. If she allows him to hold her robes, it’s a thullaccaya. If they stand together, it’s a thullaccaya. If they talk together, it’s a thullaccaya. If they make an appointment, it’s a thullaccaya. If she enters a secluded place, it’s a thullaccaya. If she waits for the man to come, it’s a thullaccaya. If she gives her body to the man like a lay woman, it’s a thullaccaya. If she fully does these eight things, she commits a pārājika.
