<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時諸比丘尼，為畜眾故受勤苦，為浣衣、染衣、割截、篸摓；弟子受大戒竟，捨和上尼去。諸比丘尼聞是事，呵責言：「是不吉弊女！我為汝作衣、浣衣、染衣、割截、篸摓，受大辛苦，受大戒已便捨我去？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，語諸比丘：「從今聽比丘尼二歲隨逐和上尼。以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼受大戒已，不二歲隨和上尼，波逸提。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, the bhikkhunīs put forth much effort to take on students. They washed, dyed, cut, pinned, and sewed robes for them. When the students had received the full ordination, they abandoned the preceptors and left. When the bhikkhunīs heard about this matter, they criticized them: “Inauspicious, inferior women, we made robes for you, we washed, dyed, cut, pinned, and sewed robes, and went through great hardship, and when you’ve received the full ordination, you just abandon us and leave?” 

Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. Because of this matter, the Buddha gathered both sanghas and said to the bhikkhus: “From now on, I allow that a bhikkhunī follows her preceptor for two years. For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī, when she has received the full ordination, doesn’t follow her preceptor for two years, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波逸提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼受大戒已，不二歲隨和上尼，波逸提。隨不隨逐和上尼，隨得爾所波逸提。(一百一十三事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī, when she has received the full ordination, doesn’t follow her preceptor for two years, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she doesn’t follow her preceptor, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 113.)
