<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在王舍城。爾時助調達二比丘尼，共一敷臥，作種種不清淨事。是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，共一敷臥？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以此事集二部僧，知而故問助調達比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，共一敷臥？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若二比丘尼共一敷臥，波夜提。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Rājagaha. At that time, two bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta lay down together on the same mat and did all kinds of impure things. 

Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you two people lie down together on the same mat?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked the bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta: “Did you really do this?” They answered: “We really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you lie down together on the same mat?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If two bhikkhunīs lie down together on the same mat, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若二比丘尼共一敷臥，波夜提。隨共臥，隨得爾所波夜提。</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If two bhikkhunīs lie down together on the same mat, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever they lie down together, they incur a pācittiya.

<lzh>不犯者，若各各有別褥，不犯。(八十八事竟)</lzh>
There’s no offense: If each has a separate mat, the offense isn’t committed. (End of rule 88.)
