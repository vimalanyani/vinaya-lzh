<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在王舍城。爾時助調達比丘尼，常入出他家。有居士婦言：「汝度我出家。」比丘尼言：「汝與我鉢，我當度汝；與我衣、戶鉤、時藥、時分藥、七日藥、盡形藥，我當度汝出家。」居士婦言：「汝等客作度人耶？」是比丘尼言：「爾。」他日諸善比丘尼，至是居士舍，居士婦問言：「汝等實客作度人耶？」善比丘尼言：「誰作是語？」居士婦言：「我語助調達比丘尼：『汝當度我出家。』便語我言：『與我鉢來，我當度汝；與我衣、戶鉤、時藥、時分藥、七日藥、盡形藥，我當度汝。』」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Rājagaha. At that time, the bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta often went in and out of people’s houses. There was the lady of a house who said: “Give me the going forth.” The bhikkhunīs said: “Give us a bowl, and we’ll ordain you. Give us robes, a door hook, medicines at the proper time, nighttime medicines, seven-day medicines, and lifetime medicines, and we’ll give you the going forth.” The lady of the house said: “Do you ordain people as a profession?” The bhikkhunīs said: “Yes.” That day, virtuous bhikkhunīs came to the householder’s house. The lady of the house asked: “Do you really ordain people as a profession?” The virtuous bhikkhunīs said: “Who said that?” The lady of the house said: “I said to the bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta: ‘Give me the going forth.’ Then they told me: ‘Bring us a bowl, and we’ll ordain you. Give us robes, a door hook, medicines at the proper time, nighttime medicines, seven-day medicines, and lifetime medicines, and we’ll ordain you.’”

<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，作是言：『汝與我鉢、與我衣、戶鉤、時藥、時分藥、七日藥、盡形藥，我當度汝？』」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問助調達比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責：「云何名比丘尼，作是言：『汝與我鉢衣來，戶鉤、時藥、時分藥、七日藥、盡形藥，我當度汝。』」佛種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼作是言：『若汝與我鉢衣、戶鉤、時藥、時分藥、七日藥、盡形藥，我當度汝。』波夜提。」</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized them: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you say: ‘Give us a bowl, give us robes, a door hook, medicines at the proper time, nighttime medicines, seven-day medicines, and lifetime medicines, and we’ll ordain you’?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked the bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta: “Did you really do this?” They answered: “We really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you say: ‘Give us a bowl and robes, a door hook, medicines at the proper time, nighttime medicines, seven-day medicines, and lifetime medicines, and we’ll ordain you’?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī says: “If you give me a bowl, a robe, a door hook, medicines at the proper time, nighttime medicines, seven-day medicines, or lifetime medicines, I’ll ordain you,” it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼作是言：「汝與我鉢衣、戶鉤、時藥、時分藥、七日藥、盡形藥，我當度汝。」皆波夜提。隨作是語，隨得波夜提。(一百二十三事)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī says: “If you give me a bowl, a robe, a door hook, medicines at the proper time, nighttime medicines, seven-day medicines, or lifetime medicines, I’ll ordain you,” all are pācittiyas. Whenever she says it, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 123.)
