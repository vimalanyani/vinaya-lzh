<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時偷蘭難陀比丘尼，有共活比丘尼病苦，偷蘭難陀比丘尼棄到餘聚落，恐須供給看病人故。諸比丘尼往到病比丘尼所言：「偷蘭難陀所有作事，汝悉與作。汝今病苦，云何看汝病？」比丘尼言：「偷蘭難陀比丘尼，當能供給我耶？恐須看我故，棄捨我去。」是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，共活比丘尼病苦，棄至餘聚落？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問偷蘭難陀：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，共活比丘尼病苦，棄至餘聚落？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼，共活比丘尼病苦不供給，波逸提。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, Thullanandā bhikkhunī was living with a bhikkhunī who was sick. Thullanandā bhikkhunī abandoned her and went to another village, because she feared that she’d have to support and look after a sick person. The bhikkhunīs went to the sick bhikkhunī and said: “Whatever things need to be done, Thullanandā can do everything for you. Now that you’re sick, how does she look after your sickness?” The bhikkhunī said: “Thullanandā should be able to support me?? Because she feared that she’d have to look after me, she abandoned me and left.” 

Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you abandon a sick bhikkhunī living with you and go to another village?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked Thullanandā: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you abandon a sick bhikkhunī living with you and go to another village?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī doesn’t support a sick bhikkhunī living with her, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波逸提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼，共活比丘尼病苦不供給，波逸提。隨不供給，隨得爾所波逸提。(一百二事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī doesn’t support a sick bhikkhunī living with her, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she doesn’t support her, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 102.)
