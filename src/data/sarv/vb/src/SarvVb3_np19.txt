<lzh>尼三十捨墮法第三(此中十九同故不出，餘不同者具出之)</lzh>
Part 3, the 30 nissaggiya pācittiya rules for bhikkhunīs. (Of which 19 aren’t included, because they’re shared. The remaining ones are unshared and are included in full.)


<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在王舍城。爾時有助調達比丘尼，多畜鉢，破壞不用。</lzh>
The Buddha was in Rājagaha. At that time, the bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta kept many bowls. They decayed and weren’t used.

<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，多畜鉢，破壞不用？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問助調達比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，多畜鉢，破壞不用？」種種因緣呵責已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼畜長鉢乃至一夜，過是畜者，尼薩耆波逸提。」</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you keep many bowls that decay and aren’t used?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked the bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta: “Did you really do this?” They answered: “We really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you keep many bowls that decay and aren’t used?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘A bhikkhunī may keep a spare bowl up to one night. If she keeps it longer, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>一夜者，從日沒至地未了，是中間名一夜。</lzh>
“One night” means from sunset to before it’s light outside (again), in between is called “one night”.

<lzh>鉢者，有三種：上、中、下。上鉢者，受三鉢他飯、一鉢他羹、餘可食物半羹，是名為上鉢。下鉢者，受一鉢他飯、半鉢他羹、餘可食物半羹，是名下鉢。上下中間，是名中鉢。若過上減下不名鉢。</lzh>
“A bowl” means that there are three kinds: A large, a middle-sized, and a small one. “A large bowl” means it can receive three other bowls of rice, one other bowl of curry, and of other edible items, half of the amount of the curry. This is called a large bowl. “A small bowl” means it can receive one other bowl of rice, half of another bowl of curry, and of other edible items, half of the amount of the curry. This is called a small bowl. What is in between the large and the small bowl is called a middle-sized bowl. If it’s larger than the big one or smaller than the small one, it’s not called a bowl.

<lzh>尼薩耆波逸提者，是鉢應捨，波逸提罪應悔過。</lzh>
“A nissaggiya pācittiya” means that this bowl should be relinquished, and the pācittiya offense should be confessed.

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼畜長鉢過一夜者，尼薩耆波逸提。(第十九事竟。前注既云同故不出，此同比丘何獨重出？此但一夜，彼過十日耳。)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī keeps a spare bowl for more than one night, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. (End of rule 19. The shared precepts were previously already explained and aren’t included, so why is this one shared precept with the bhikkhus included? Because here it’s just for one night, and there it’s for more than 10 days.)
