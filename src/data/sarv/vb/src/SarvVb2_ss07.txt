<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時諸比丘，近婆祇多城起僧坊，是中漸漸多。有居士家圍繞，有象鳴、馬鳴、大小男女音聲故，妨諸比丘讀經、坐禪、行道。是中有居士，名安闍那，有威德多饒財寶、人民田宅、𤥭𤦲馬瑙，種種富貴相貌成就。諸比丘教令餘處起僧坊，居士即於安闍那林中起僧坊，諸比丘捨近城僧坊，入安闍那林僧坊中住。諸比丘尼遊行憍薩羅國向舍衛國，次到婆祇陀城，故僧坊中宿。見其中床榻、臥具、盆器、釜鑊種種備具清淨可住，諸比丘尼往語比丘言：「諸大德已捨此僧坊者，我等當於中住。」諸比丘言：「隨意。」是僧坊主死，後諸兒分財物，是僧坊亦在分中。</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, the bhikkhus built a monastery close to the city of Sāketa, and over time it became crowded. It was surrounded by lay houses, and because there were the noises of elephants and horses, and the sounds of old and young men and women, it prevented the bhikkhus from reciting suttas, sitting in meditation, and practicing the path. Among the householders was one called Añjana, who had authority, virtue, and an abundance of wealth, people, fields and land, Tridacna stones, agate, and he had achieved all kinds of riches and a beautiful appearance. The bhikkhus instructed him to have a monastery built in another place, and the householder then built a monastery in the Añjana grove. The bhikkhus gave up the monastery close to the city, and lived in the monastery in the Añjana grove. Bhikkhunīs were wandering in the country of Kosala towards Sāvatthī, eventually reached Sāketa, and spent the night in the old monastery. They saw that there were beds and couches, bedding, basins and utensils, pots and pans, all kinds of equipment, and it was clean and livable. The bhikkhunīs went to the bhikkhus and said: “The venerables have given up this monastery, we’ll stay there.” The bhikkhus said: “As you please.” Then the owner of the monastery died, and when his children later divided the assets, this monastery was also among them.
<lzh>一兒得此僧坊者，往語比丘尼言：「汝等出去。」諸比丘尼言：「何故使我等出耶？」答言：「我分得此僧坊。」比丘尼言：「我不從汝得，我從諸比丘得。若諸比丘使我出者，我當出，不隨汝語。」是中有比丘尼，名修目佉，是婆羅門種中出家，勦健多力，作強語共諍。居士兒不忍瞋故，便打比丘尼，是比丘尼即詣眾官言：「某甲兒打我。」眾官問言：「何故打汝？」比丘尼即廣說上事。眾官言：「諸沙門釋子不應失是僧坊。何以故？公與兒奪，兒與公奪，事不得爾。」眾官遣人召是兒來，問言：「汝打比丘尼不？」答言：「實打。」眾官按法律撿挍：「打出家人應得何罪？」</lzh>
One child received this monastery and they went to the bhikkhunīs and said: “Go away.” The bhikkhunīs said: “Why do you make us leave?” They answered: “I received this monastery as my share.” The bhikkhunīs said: “We haven’t received it from you, we received it from the bhikkhus. If the bhikkhus make us leave, we’ll leave, but we don’t follow your words.” Among the bhikkhunīs was one called Sumuttā who had gone forth from a brahmin clan, and was nimble, sturdy, and strong. She spoke forcefully and quarreled with them. Because the householder’s child was impatient and angry, they beat the bhikkhunī. That bhikkhunī then went to the judges and said: “Such-and-such’s child beat me.” The judges asked: “Why did they beat you?” The bhikkhunī then explained the matter in detail. The judges said: “The renunciates that are Sakyan children shouldn’t lose this monastery. Why? That a father gives something and a child snatches it back, or that a child gives something and a father snatches it back, that shouldn’t happen.” The judges sent someone to summon the child to come, and asked them: “Did you beat the bhikkhunī?” They answered: “I really beat her.” The judges investigated according to the law: “Which offense should be incurred by someone who beats a renunciate?”
<lzh>律言：「隨所用身分即應截之。」眾官問言：「汝以何物打？」答言：「手打。」又問：「何手？」答言：「右手。」即截右手。爾時惡名流布：「諸沙門釋女言人截他手。」一人語二人，二人語三人，如是展轉滿婆祇多城。</lzh>
The law said: “The body part they used should be cut off.” The judges asked: “With which item did you beat her?” They answered: “I beat her with my hand.” They asked again: “Which hand?” They answered: “The right hand.” Then they cut off their right hand. At that time, a bad reputation spread around: “These renunciates that are Sakyan daughters tell people to cut off someone’s hand.” One person told two people, two people told three, and in this way, the whole city of Sāketa gradually heard about it.

<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責：「云何名比丘尼，言人令截他手？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問修目佉比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，言人令截他手？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與諸比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼，詣王、若官人、若婆羅門、若居士所，恃勢言人者，是法初犯僧伽娑尸沙可悔過。」</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you talk to people to make them cut off someone’s hand?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked Sumuttā bhikkhunī: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you talk to people to make them cut off someone’s hand?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī goes to a king, judges, brahmins, or householders, and relying on their authority speaks about someone, that act is an immediate saṅghādisesa, from which one can repent.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>王者，剎利種受王位水澆頂，是名為王剎利水澆頂。若婆羅門、若居士、若女人受王職，亦名為王水澆頂。</lzh>
“A king” means someone from a khattiya clan who has received the position of a king by sprinkling water on their head. This is called a khattiya king by sprinkling water on their head. If a brahmin, a householder, or a woman has received the position of a king, it’s also called “a king by sprinkling water on their head.”

<lzh>官人者，食官廩田宅。</lzh>
“A judge” means someone who lives off a judge’s salary, fields, and land.

<lzh>婆羅門者，婆羅門種中生。</lzh>
“A brahmin” means someone born into a brahmin clan.

<lzh>居士者，除王、除官人、除婆羅門，餘不出家人，名為居士。</lzh>
“A householder” means except for a king, a judge, or a brahmin, everyone else who hasn’t gone forth is called “a householder”.

<lzh>恃勢言人者，依他勢力喜鬪諍相言。</lzh>
“Relying on their authority she speaks about someone” means that relying on someone else’s authority, she likes to quarrel and talk about others.

<lzh>僧伽婆尸沙者，是罪屬僧，僧中有殘，因僧前悔過除滅，是名僧伽婆尸沙。</lzh>
“A saṅghādisesa” means this offense is dependent upon the sangha, and in the sangha there’s a remainder. Because she confesses and clears it in front of the sangha, therefore it’s called a saṅghādisesa. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼，詣王、若眾官、婆羅門、居士，恃勢力言人者，僧伽婆尸沙。若斷事時，在斷事人前瞋恨呵罵本所打人者，僧伽婆尸沙。若向餘人，呵罵本所打人者，偷蘭遮。</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī goes to a king, judges, brahmins, or householders, and relying on their authority speaks about someone, it’s a saṅghādisesa. If, when matters are being settled, she angrily criticizes someone who previously beat her to the person who is settling matters, it’s a saṅghādisesa. If she criticizes someone who previously beat her to someone else, it’s a thullaccaya.

<lzh>若屏處瞋罵，不言者，不犯。(第七戒竟)</lzh>
If she angrily criticizes them in a secluded place, or doesn’t speak, the offense isn’t committed. (End of rule 7.)
