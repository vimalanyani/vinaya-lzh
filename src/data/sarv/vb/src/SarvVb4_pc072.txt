<lzh>百七十八單波夜提法
(前七十一與大僧同故不出，從此第七十二戒已下一百七戒不同比丘故別明之。)</lzh>
178 simple pācittiya rules
(Because the first 71 rules are in common with the bhikkhu sangha, they’re not included. From this 72nd precept onwards, 107 precepts are explained, since they’re not in common with the bhikkhus.)


<lzh>初食蒜戒</lzh>
First: The precept on eating garlic.


<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時有守蒜園人，名阿耆達多，是人蒜菜茂盛，請諸比丘尼言：「須蒜者來取。」時式叉摩尼、沙彌尼，一年來拔蒜，至二、三年蒜園不成，即捨蒜園去，不能復種。更有居士，於故處種蒜，諸式叉摩尼、沙彌尼，以本意故，復來拔蒜。是園主作是念：「誰偷我蒜，我當伺捕。」是居士即於屏處伺看，見諸式叉摩尼、沙彌尼拔蒜，居士言：「莫取我蒜。」答言：「舍衛城阿耆達多居士，請我取蒜，何豫汝事？」是居士言：「本田主以汝等因緣故，捨田而去。今我於中種蒜，汝等莫取。」諸式叉摩尼、沙彌尼羞，作是言：「我等不知，自今以後不敢復取。」諸居士瞋呵責言：「諸比丘尼自言：『善好有功德。』噉蒜如白衣女。」是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，噉蒜如白衣女？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問是比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，噉蒜如白衣女？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, there was a man called Agnidatta who kept a garlic garden. That man’s garlic plants were growing abundantly, and he invited the bhikkhunīs: “If you need garlic, come and take some.” Then the sikkhamānas and sāmaṇerīs came and pulled garlic out in the first year, until in the second and third year, the garlic garden didn’t produce plants anymore. Even when they gave up going to the garlic garden, it couldn’t regrow again. Then there was a householder who planted garlic again in the old place. The sikkhamānas and sāmaṇerīs, because of the original invitation, came again to pull garlic out. The garden’s owner thought: “Who is stealing my garlic? I shall investigate and arrest them.” Then that householder observed from a hidden place and saw the sikkhamānas and sāmaṇerīs pull garlic out. The householder said: “Don’t take my garlic.” They answered: “The householder Agnidatta of Sāvatthī has invited us to take garlic. How is that your business?” That householder said: “The original owner of the field has given up the field and left because of what you did. Now I’ve planted garlic here. Don’t take it.” The sikkhamānas and sāmaṇerīs felt ashamed and said: “We didn’t know. From now on, we won’t dare to take it again.” The householders angrily criticized them: “These bhikkhunīs say of themselves: ‘We’re virtuous and have merit’, but they eat garlic like lay women.” 

Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you eat garlic like lay women?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked those bhikkhunīs: “Did you really do this?” They answered: “We really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you eat garlic like lay women?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus:
<note> The second part of the origin story seems to be a stock passage that was inserted without properly connecting it to the first part. First, Sikkhamānas and Sāmaṇerīs pluck garlic, and later the bhikkhunīs seem to be the offenders.</note>


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>若比丘尼噉生蒜、熟蒜，波夜提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī eats raw or cooked garlic, it’s a pācittiya.’”


Explanations 

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼噉生蒜，波夜提。噉熟蒜，波夜提。若噉蒜子，波夜提。若噉莖葉，波夜提。若噉蒜皮蒜鬚，突吉羅。若治病、若塗瘡，不犯。(七十二事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī eats raw garlic, it’s a pācittiya. If she eats cooked garlic, it’s a pācittiya. If she eats garlic seedlings, it’s a pācittiya. If she eats the stalk and the leaves, it’s a pācittiya. If she eats the skin and the roots of the garlic, it’s a dukkaṭa. If she treats an illness or applies it on a wound, there’s no offense. (End of rule 72.)
