<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在王舍城。爾時助調達比丘尼，半月半月不往僧中求教誡。</lzh>
The Buddha was in Rājagaha. At that time, the bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta, didn’t go to the sangha every half-month to request instruction.

<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，半月半月不往僧中求教誡？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問助調達比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，半月半月不往僧中求教誡？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼，半月半月不往僧中求教誡，波夜提。」</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you don’t go to the sangha every half-month to request instruction?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked the bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta: “Did you really do this?” They answered: “We really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you don’t go to the sangha every half-month to request instruction?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī doesn’t go to the sangha every half-month to request instruction, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼半月不往僧中求教誡，波夜提。隨不求，隨得波夜提。(一百五十一事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī doesn’t go to the sangha every half-month to request instruction, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she doesn’t request it, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 151.)
