<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時偷蘭難陀比丘尼，不囑他房舍，遊行聚落中。後失火燒僧坊，諸比丘尼各各自出衣鉢，共相謂言：「出偷蘭難陀比丘尼衣鉢。」有比丘尼言：「偷蘭難陀惡性喜瞋，失言不失、燒言不燒。」都不與出，火燒物盡。</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, Thullanandā bhikkhunī, without informing others at the residence, went wandering among the villages. Later, a fire broke out and burnt the monastery. The bhikkhunīs each brought their robes and bowls outside, and said to each other: “Let’s bring Thullanandā bhikkhunī’s robes and bowl outside.” Some bhikkhunīs said: “Thullanandā has a bad character and likes to be angry. She’ll say of what is lost that it wasn’t lost, and of what is burnt that it didn’t burn.” They all didn’t bring her things outside, and the fire burnt everything.

<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責：「云何名比丘尼，不囑他房舍，遊行聚落中？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問偷蘭難陀比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責：「云何名比丘尼，不囑他房舍，遊行聚落中？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼，不囑他房舍，至聚落中，波夜提。」</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you, without informing others at the residence, go wandering among the villages?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked Thullanandā bhikkhunī: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you, without informing others at the residence, go wandering among the villages?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī, without informing others at the residence, walks among the villages, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼，不以房舍囑他，至聚落中，波夜提。隨不囑他，隨得波夜提。(一百三十九事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī, without informing others at the residence, walks among the villages, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she doesn’t inform others, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 139.)
