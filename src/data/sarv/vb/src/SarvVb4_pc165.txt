<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在王舍城。爾時助調達比丘尼，不自以香塗身，復不自以香揩身，胡麻屑、胡麻滓揩身，使式叉摩尼、沙彌尼、白衣女揩身。</lzh>
The Buddha was in Rājagaha. At that time, the bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta didn’t apply perfume on their bodies themselves, and neither rubbed (mud) perfume, ground sesame, and sesame dregs on their bodies. But they had sikkhamānās, sāmaṇerīs, and lay women rub them on their bodies.

<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，使式叉摩尼、沙彌尼、白衣女以香塗身，復以香揩身，胡麻屑、胡麻滓揩身？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問助調達比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，使式叉摩尼、沙彌尼、白衣女以香塗身，復以香揩身，胡麻屑、胡麻滓揩身？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼，使人以香塗身復以香揩身，胡麻屑、胡麻滓揩身，波夜提。」</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you have sikkhamānās, sāmaṇerīs, and lay women apply perfume on your bodies, and have them rub (mud) perfume, ground sesame, and sesame dregs on your bodies?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked the bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta: “Did you really do this?” They answered: “We really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you have sikkhamānās, sāmaṇerīs, and lay women apply perfume on your bodies, and have them rub (mud) perfume, ground sesame, and sesame dregs on your bodies?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī has others apply perfume on her body, or has them rub (mud) perfume, ground sesame, and sesame dregs on her body, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼，使人以香揩身，波夜提。若使人以香塗身，波夜提。胡麻屑、胡麻滓揩身，皆波夜提。隨使人揩，隨得爾所波夜提。(一百六十五事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī has others rub perfume on her body, it’s a pācittiya. If she has others apply (mud) perfume on her body, it’s a pācittiya. If they rub ground sesame or sesame dregs on her body, all are pācittiyas. Whenever she has others rub her, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 165.)
