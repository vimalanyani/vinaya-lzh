<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在王舍城。爾時助調達比丘尼，以刷刷頭。諸居士呵責言：「諸比丘尼自言：『善好有功德。』以刷刷頭，如白衣女。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Rājagaha. At that time, the bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta brushed their hair with brushes. The householders criticized them: “These bhikkhunīs say of themselves: ‘We’re virtuous and have merit’, but they brush their hair with brushes, like lay women.”

<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問助調達比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，以刷刷頭？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼以刷刷頭，波夜提。」</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked the bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta: “Did you really do this?” They answered: “We really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you brush your hair with brushes?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī brushes her hair with a brush, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼以刷刷頭，波夜提。隨刷刷，隨得爾所波夜提。(一百六十八事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī brushes her hair with a brush, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she brushes, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 168.)
