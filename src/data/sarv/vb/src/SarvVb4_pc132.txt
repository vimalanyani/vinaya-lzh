<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在王舍城。爾時助調達比丘尼，常入出諸家。諸居士婦言：「與我少許衣段，守護小兒故。」是比丘尼即脫衣與。後諸善比丘尼復到是家，諸居士婦言：「與我少許衣段，守護小兒故。」善比丘尼言：「汝等倒語，白衣應與出家人衣，而反從我索。我等受他信施，云何壞他供養？」居士婦言：「汝等慳惜，前有比丘尼來，我索小段，便脫衣與我。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Rājagaha. At that time, the bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta often went in and out of lay houses. The female householders said: “Give us a small piece of your robes to protect our babies.” The bhikkhunīs then took off their robes and gave them. Later, virtuous bhikkhunīs also came to these houses. The female householders said: “Give us a small piece of your robes to protect our babies.” The virtuous bhikkhunīs said: “Your words are inverted. Lay people should give robes to renunciates, but you ask from us instead. We receive gifts of faith from others, how could we destroy their offerings?” The female householders said: “You’re stingy. Earlier, bhikkhunīs came, we asked them for a small piece, and they took off their robes and gave them to us.”
<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責：「云何名比丘尼，以衣與白衣？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問助調達比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責：「云何名比丘尼，以衣與白衣？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼以衣與白衣，波逸提。」</lzh>

Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you give robes to lay people?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked the bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta: “Did you really do this?” They answered: “We really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you give robes to lay people?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī gives a robe to a lay person, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波逸提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼，以衣與白衣，波逸提。隨與，隨得波逸提。(一百三十二事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī gives a robe to a lay person, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she gives one, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 132.)
