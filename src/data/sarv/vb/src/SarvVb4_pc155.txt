<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國，爾時迦羅比丘尼，本是外道，喜鬪諍瞋恚，共諸比丘尼鬪諍惡口恐他，作是言：「某王是我相識是我檀越，某大臣、鬪將、居士，是我相識檀越，當用是力治汝。」諸比丘尼恐怖。</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, Kālī bhikkhunī, who was formerly a non-Buddhist renunciate, liked to quarrel and be angry. When she quarreled with the bhikkhunīs, she frightened them with abusive language, by saying: “King So-and-so is my friend and supporter. The high official, general, or householder So-and-so is my friend and supporter. I’ll punish you under their authority.” The bhikkhunīs were scared.
<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，共他鬪諍惡口恐他，作是言：『某王是我相識是我檀越，某大臣、鬪將、居士，是我相識檀越，當用是力治汝。』令諸比丘尼恐怖？」種種因緣呵責已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣訶責言：「云何名比丘尼，共他鬪諍惡口恐他，作是言：『某王與我相識是我檀越，某大臣、鬪將、居士，與我相識檀越，當用是力治汝。』令諸比丘尼恐怖？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼，共比丘尼鬪諍惡口恐怖他，波夜提。」</lzh>

Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you, while quarreling with others, frighten them with abusive language, by saying: ‘King So-and-so is my friend and supporter. The high official, general, or householder So-and-so is my friend and supporter. I’ll punish you under their authority,’ and scare the bhikkhunīs?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked her: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you, while quarreling with others, frighten them with abusive language, by saying: ‘King So-and-so is my friend and supporter. The high official, general, or householder So-and-so is my friend and supporter. I’ll punish you under their authority,’ and scare the bhikkhunīs?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī quarrels with the bhikkhunīs and frightens them with abusive language, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼，共比丘尼鬪諍惡口，恐怖他言：「某王是我知識，當以王力治汝。」波夜提。「大臣力、鬪將力、居士力治汝。」皆波夜提。隨作是語，隨得爾所波夜提。(一百五十五事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī quarrels with the bhikkhunīs and frightens them with abusive language, by saying: “King So-and-so is my friend. I’ll punish you under the king’s authority,” it’s a pācittiya. “I’ll punish you under the high official’s authority, the general’s authority, or the householder’s authority,” all are pācittiyas. Whenever she says this, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 155.)
