<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時偷蘭難陀比丘尼，月病休止，浣病衣已淨不欲起去，妨餘有月病比丘尼。不得故處，諸比丘尼苦惱。是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責：「云何名比丘尼，月病休止，浣病衣已淨不欲起去？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問偷蘭難陀比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，月病休止，得浣衣竟不欲起去？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼月病休止，浣衣已淨不起去者，波夜提。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, Thullanandā bhikkhunī’s menses had ended and she had washed the menstrual robe cleanly, but she didn’t want to let go of it, and it inconvenienced other bhikkhunīs who had their menses. When they didn’t obtain any in the usual place, the bhikkhunīs suffered. 

Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you, after your menses has ended and you’ve washed the menstrual robe cleanly, don’t want to let go of it?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked Thullanandā bhikkhunī: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you, after your menses has ended and you’ve washed the cloth, don’t want to let go of it?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī, when her menses has ended and she has washed the cloth cleanly, doesn’t let go of it, it’s a pācittiya.”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼月病休止，浣衣已淨不起去者，波夜提。隨不起，隨得波夜提。(一百三十三事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī, when her menses has ended and she has washed the cloth cleanly, doesn’t let go of it, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she doesn’t let go of it, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 133.)
