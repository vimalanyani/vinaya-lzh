<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時迦羅比丘尼，本是外道，喜行遊觀。是比丘尼早起，到天祠中、伎樂舍、論法舍、出家舍、看畫彩舍，諸居士呵責言：「諸比丘尼自言：『善好有功德。』故往看畫舍，如外道女。」是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問迦羅比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，故往看畫舍？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼故往看畫舍，波逸提。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, Kālī bhikkhunī, who was formerly a non-Buddhist renunciate, liked to wander for sightseeing. This bhikkhunī got up early, went into a brahminical temple, to a theater, to a debating hall, to the residence of renunciates, and visited a picture gallery. The householders criticized her: “These bhikkhunīs say of themselves: ‘We’re virtuous and have merit’, but she intentionally goes to see a picture gallery, like a non-Buddhist renunciate.”

Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked Kālī bhikkhunī: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you intentionally go to see a picture gallery?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī intentionally goes to see a picture gallery, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波逸提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼，故往看畫舍，能得見者波逸提，不得見者突吉羅。若從下至高處，能得見者波逸提，不得見者突吉羅。若從高至下，能得見者波逸提，不能得見者突吉羅。若不故往，道由中過者，不犯。(九十九事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī intentionally goes to see a picture gallery, and she’s able to see it, it’s a pācittiya. If she’s not able to see it, it’s a dukkaṭa. If she goes from below to a high place to be able to see it, it’s a pācittiya. If she’s not able to see it, it’s a dukkaṭa. If she goes from a high place to a low place to be able to see it, it’s a pācittiya. If she’s not able to see it, it’s a dukkaṭa. If she goes unintentionally, and the road passes by there, the offense isn’t committed. (End of rule 99.)
