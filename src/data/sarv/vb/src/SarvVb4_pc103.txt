<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時長老大迦葉中前著衣持鉢入一居士家，為乞食故。時所立處有居士婦，遙見大迦葉即起出迎。偷蘭難陀先在其家，遙見大迦葉不起往迎。是居士婦以手接足，頭面禮長老摩訶迦葉已，洗手取鉢，盛滿飯以羹澆上與，大迦葉持去。居士婦到偷蘭難陀所言：「汝知是長老大迦葉，是佛大弟子，天人所敬良祐福田，汝若起迎者有何惡事？」偷蘭難陀言：「大迦葉本是外道婆羅門，汝所貴敬，非我所尊。」居士婦瞋呵責言：「諸比丘尼自言：『善好有功德。』見比丘來不起，如外道女。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, the venerable Mahākassapa, before midday, put on his robes, took his bowl, and entered a householder’s home on almsround. Then, in the house where he was standing, there was a lady of the house. She saw Mahākassapa from a distance, got up, came out, and welcomed him. Thullanandā had been in that house first, and when she saw Mahākassapa from a distance, she didn’t get up, nor go to welcome him. When the lady of the house had touched his feet with her hands, and had paid respect with her head at the venerable Mahākassapa’s feet, she washed her hands, took his bowl, filled it completely with rice, sprinkled curries on top, and gave it to him. Mahākassapa took it and left. The lady of the house went to Thullanandā and said: “You know that this was the venerable Mahākassapa, the Buddha’s great disciple, respected by gods and humans, a good friend, and field of merit. If you had gotten up and welcomed him, how could that have been a bad thing?” Thullanandā said: “Mahākassapa was formerly a non-Buddhist renunciate, a brahmin. The one you value and respect isn’t who I honor.” The lady of the house angrily criticized her: “These bhikkhunīs say of themselves: ‘We’re virtuous and have merit’, but they don’t get up when they see a bhikkhu coming, like non-Buddhist renunciates.”

<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，見比丘來不起？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼見比丘來不起，波逸提。」</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked her: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you don’t get up when you see a bhikkhu coming?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī sees a bhikkhu coming and doesn’t get up, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波逸提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼見比丘來不起，波逸提。隨見不起，隨得爾所波逸提。(一百三事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī sees a bhikkhu coming and doesn’t get up, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she sees him and doesn’t get up, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 103.)
