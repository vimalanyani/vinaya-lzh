<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在王舍城。爾時助調達比丘尼，喜門中立。諸居士呵責言：「諸比丘尼自言：『善好有功德。』在門中立如婬女。」是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問助調達比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，喜門中立？」種種呵已語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼在門中立，波夜提。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Rājagaha. At that time, the bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta liked to stand at the gate. The householders criticized them: “These bhikkhunīs say of themselves: ‘We’re virtuous and have merit’, but they stand at the gate like prostitutes.” 

Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked the bhikkhunīs supporting Devadatta: “Did you really do this?” They answered: “We really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you like to stand at the gate?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī stands at the gate, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼在門中立，波夜提。隨門中立，隨得爾所波夜提。(一百七十八波夜提事具足竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī stands at the gate, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she stands at the gate, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of all 178 pācittiya rules.)
