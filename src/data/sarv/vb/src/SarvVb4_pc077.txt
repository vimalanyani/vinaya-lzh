<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時有一居士，以無常因緣故，失財物田宅，家人死盡，唯有夫婦二人。居士作是念：「諸福德樂人無衰惱者，無過沙門釋子，我何不詣彼求出家？」夫即詣祇洹作比丘，婦詣王園精舍作比丘尼。是比丘得食時，持食詣比丘尼精舍，是比丘尼先為辦盤醬菜果蓏，待比丘來。時此比丘持食詣比丘尼精舍坐食，此比丘尼起與醬菜，並說本居家中時事。比丘瞋不忍故，即以手中飯擲比丘尼面。比丘尼瞋故，以熱羹澆比丘頭，不淨可羞。是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，比丘食時在前立侍？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問是比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責：「云何名比丘尼，比丘食時在前立侍？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, there was a householder, who due to impermanent conditions had lost his wealth, fields, and house. His family members had passed away, and there were only two persons left, the husband and the wife. The householder thought: “There are virtuous and happy people without distress. Unsurpassed among them are the renunciates that are Sakyan children. Why don’t I go there and ask for the going forth?” The husband then went to Jetavana and became a bhikkhu. The wife went to the monastery in the king’s park and became a bhikkhunī. When the bhikkhu received food, the kept the food and went to the bhikkhunī monastery. That bhikkhunī had earlier prepared a dish of vegetable and fruit sauce and was waiting for the bhikkhu to come. When the bhikkhu who was keeping his food arrived at the bhikkhunī monastery and sat down to eat, the bhikkhunī got up and offered the vegetable sauce. They both spoke about matters from the time of their previous household life. Because the bhikkhu became so angry that he couldn’t stand it anymore, he threw the food in his hand into the bhikkhunī’s face. And because the bhikkhunī became angry, she poured the hot curry on the bhikkhu’s head. Being dirty, they felt ashamed.

Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized her: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you, when a bhikkhu is eating, stand in front waiting?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked that bhikkhunī: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you, when a bhikkhu is eating, stand in front waiting?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus:


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>若比丘尼，比丘食時在前立侍，波夜提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī, when a bhikkhu is eating, stands in front waiting, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼，比丘食時在前立侍，波夜提。隨立，隨得爾所波夜提。若與比丘食已還坐、若餘處去，不犯。(七十七事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī, when a bhikkhu is eating, stands in front waiting, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she stands there, she incurs a pācittiya. If after giving food to the bhikkhu, she returns to her seat, or goes to another place, the offense isn’t committed. (End of rule 77.)
