<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時偷蘭難陀比丘尼得他質錢，腰絡著市中行，有鈴聲出。諸居士聞已呵責言：「諸比丘尼自言：『善好有功德。』著腰絡行市中，如王夫人、如大臣婦。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, Thullanandā bhikkhunī obtained a “hip net”<note> an ornamental belt with multiple strands.</note> pawned by someone, and went to the market wearing it. It jingled, and when the householders heard it, they criticized her: “These bhikkhunīs say of themselves: ‘We’re virtuous and have merit’, but they wear hip nets to go to the market, like queens and wives of high officials.”

<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問偷蘭難陀比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，著腰絡？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼著腰絡，波夜提。」</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked Thullanandā bhikkhunī: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you wear a hip net?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī wears a “hip net”, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼著腰絡，波夜提。若作，突吉羅。若治，突吉羅。若與他著，突吉羅。(一百四十七事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī wears a hip net, it’s a pācittiya. If she makes one, it’s a dukkaṭa. If she looks after one, it’s a dukkaṭa. If she gives it to someone else to wear, it’s a dukkaṭa. (End of rule 147.)
