<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在釋氏國。是中有比丘尼，名結髮，作法師善能說法。見一年少比丘，無深智慧，即問難阿毘曇事，是比丘不能隨順問答。是比丘尼出，自貢高語諸比丘尼言：「我今問一比丘阿毘曇事，不能隨順答我。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in the Sakyan country. Among the bhikkhunīs was one called Jaṭilā who was a dhamma teacher and able to speak on dhamma. She saw a young bhikkhu, without deep wisdom, and then asked him about a difficult matter of abhidhamma. This bhikkhu couldn’t answer according to the question. The bhikkhunī left, and arrogantly told the other bhikkhunīs: “I just asked a bhikkhu about a matter of abhidhamma, and he couldn’t answer me accordingly.”

<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，比丘不聽問經、律、阿毘曇事便問？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問結髮比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣訶責言：「云何名比丘尼，比丘不聽問經、律、阿毘曇事便問？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼，比丘不聽問經、律、阿毘曇事便問，波夜提。」</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you, when a bhikkhu hasn’t allowed to ask him about sutta, vinaya, or abhidhamma matters, just ask?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked Jaṭilā bhikkhunī: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you, when a bhikkhu hasn’t allowed to ask him about sutta, vinaya, or abhidhamma matters, just ask?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī, when a bhikkhu hasn’t allowed to ask him about sutta, vinaya, or abhidhamma matters, just asks, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼，比丘不聽問難經、律、阿毘曇中事，若以偈問，偈偈波夜提；若以章問，章章波夜提；若別句問，句句波夜提。(一百五十八事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī, when a bhikkhu hasn’t allowed to ask him about a difficult matter in the suttas, the vinaya, or the abhidhamma, asks in verses, each verse is a pācittiya. If she asks in chapters, each chapter is a pācittiya. If she asks in another form, each sentence is a pācittiya. (End of rule 158.)
