<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時偷蘭難陀比丘尼，以掌拍女根。諸比丘尼問言：「汝作何等？」答言：「欲使肥好。」是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，以手掌拍女根欲使肥好？」種種因緣呵已向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問偷蘭難陀：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責：「云何名比丘尼，以手掌拍女根欲使肥好？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒，從今是戒應如是說：</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, Thullanandā bhikkhunī patted her vagina with her palm. The bhikkhunīs asked her: “What are you doing?” She answered: “I want to make it swell up for pleasure.” 

Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you pat your vagina with the palm of your hand, wanting to make it swell up for pleasure?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked Thullanandā: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you pat your vagina with the palm of your hand, wanting to make it swell up for pleasure?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus:


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<lzh>若比丘尼以掌拍女根，波夜提。」</lzh>
‘If a bhikkhunī pats her vagina with her palm, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>掌者，有二種：手掌、脚掌。</lzh>
“Palm” means there are two kinds: The palm of the hand, and the palm (i.e. the sole) of the foot. 

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼以手掌拍女根，波夜提。若以脚掌拍，亦波夜提。除手脚掌，以餘物拍，突吉羅。(七十五竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī pats her vagina with the palm of her hand, it’s a pācittiya. If she pats with the palm of her foot, it’s also a pācittiya. If she pats with an object other than the palm of her her hand or foot, it’s a dukkaṭa. (End of rule 75.)
