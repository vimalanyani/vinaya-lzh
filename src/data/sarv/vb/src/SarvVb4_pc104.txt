<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時長老迦留陀夷常出入一家，中前著衣持鉢到其舍。有比丘尼，名瘦瞿曇彌，先在是家，遙見迦留陀夷來，即起出迎入示坐處、共相問訊、頭面禮足、前叉手立。迦留陀夷為說法久，是比丘尼迷悶眼闇倒地，居士婦即以水灑面還得本心。居士婦言：「汝何所患苦？何所憂愁？」答言：「我無病、無憂愁，但久立住故，迷悶倒地。」諸比丘尼以是事白佛，佛以是事集二部僧，種種因緣讚戒、讚持戒，讚戒、讚持戒已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼，不問比丘便坐者，波逸提。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, the venerable Kāḷudāyī often went in and out of a house. Before midday, he put on his robes, took his bowl, and went to that house. There was a bhikkhunī called Kisāgotamī who was at that house first. She saw Kāḷudāyī coming from a distance. Then she got up, came out to welcome him, entered, and showed him a place to sit. They greeted each other, she paid respect with her head at his feet, and stood in front with her hands together. Kāḷudāyī spoke about dhamma for a long time, and this bhikkhunī became dizzy, her vision went black, and she fell to the ground. The lady of the house then sprinkled her face with water and returned her to her previous state. The lady of the house said: “From what do you suffer? What worries you?” She answered: “I’m not sick, I don’t have any worries. Just because I stood for a long time, I became dizzy and fell to the ground.” 

The bhikkhunīs spoke with the Buddha about this matter and he therefore gathered both sanghas. In all kinds of ways, he praised the precepts and praised keeping precepts. Having praised the precepts and praised keeping precepts, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī just sits down without asking a bhikkhu, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波逸提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼，不問比丘輒坐者，波逸提。隨不問坐，隨得爾所波逸提。(一百四事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī just sits down without asking a bhikkhu, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she sits down without asking, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 104.)
