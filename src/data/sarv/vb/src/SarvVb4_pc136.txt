<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時諸比丘尼僧，打揵搥欲捨迦絺那衣。優婆和比丘尼，作僧斷事人，不欲到僧中，遣比丘尼喚言：「善女來！比丘尼僧欲捨迦絺那衣。」瞋言：「我是僧斷事人，何故不問我而打揵搥？我不能去。」即以是因緣故，不成捨迦絺那衣。</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, the bhikkhunī sangha struck the bell wanting to relinquish the kaṭhina robe. Upavānā(?) bhikkhunī acted as the sangha official for settling matters, and she didn’t want to go to the sangha. They sent a bhikkhunī to summon her: “Good woman, come! The bhikkhunī sangha wants to relinquish the kaṭhina robe.” She said angrily: “I’m the sangha offical for settling matters. Why didn’t you ask me before striking the bell? I’m unable to go.” Then for this reason, they didn’t accomplish the relinquishing of the kaṭhina robe.

<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，僧欲捨迦絺那衣，不隨順從？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問優婆和比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責：「云何名比丘尼，僧捨迦絺那衣不隨順？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼，僧捨迦絺那衣時不隨者，波夜提。」</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you don’t go along with the sangha that wants to relinquish the kaṭhina robe?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked Upavānā bhikkhunī: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you don’t go along with the sangha that’s relinquishing the kaṭhina robe?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī, when the sangha is relinquishing the kaṭhina robe, doesn’t go along, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼，僧捨迦絺那衣時不隨者，波夜提。隨不隨順，隨得波夜提。(一百三十六事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī, when the sangha is relinquishing the kaṭhina robe, doesn’t go along, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she doesn’t go along, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 136.)
