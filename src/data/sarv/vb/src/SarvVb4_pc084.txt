<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時王園比丘尼僧坊中，有客作人，日暮雨墮故，入助調達比丘尼房中。時助調達比丘尼，有大式叉摩尼。是客作人先不與期，夜中摩觸式叉摩尼，式叉摩尼大喚。多比丘尼集，問言：「何故？」式叉摩尼言：「然燈。」問言：「何故？」「但然燈來。」即然燈來，見偷蘭難陀比丘尼於闇中共男子坐。是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責：「云何名比丘尼，闇中無燈共男子坐？」種種因緣呵責已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧知而故問：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，闇中無燈共白衣男子坐？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼闇中無燈，與男子共立共坐，波夜提。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, there was a worker in the bhikkhunī monastery in the king’s park. Because it was raining at dusk, he entered the room of a bhikkhunī supporting Devadatta. Then the bhikkhunī supporting Devadatta had a sikkhamānā who was grown up. Without having previously made an appointment, this worker touched the sikkhamāna during the night, and the sikkhamānā screamed loudly. Many bhikkhunīs gathered and asked her why. The sikkhamānā said: “Light a lamp.” They asked: “Why?” “Just bring a lit lamp.” Then they brought a lit lamp, and saw Thullanandā bhikkhunī sitting with a man in the dark. 

Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you sit together with a man in the dark without a lamp?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked her: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you sit together with a lay man in the dark without a lamp?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī stands and sits together with a man in the dark without a lamp, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼闇中無燈，與男子共立共坐，波夜提。隨共立共坐，隨得爾所波夜提。(八十四事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī stands and sits together with a man in the dark without a lamp, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she stands and sits together, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 84.)
