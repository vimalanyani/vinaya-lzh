<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在王舍城。爾時助調達比丘尼，獨與一白衣男子屏處共立共語。是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，獨與一白衣男子屏處共立共語？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問助調達比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責：「云何名比丘尼，獨與一白衣男子屏處共立共語？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼，獨與一白衣男子屏處共立、共語，波夜提。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Rājagaha. At that time, a bhikkhunī supporting Devadatta stood and talked together with a lay man alone in a secluded place. 

Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you stand and talk together with one lay man alone in a secluded place?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked the bhikkhunī supporting Devadatta: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you stand and talk together with one lay man alone in a secluded place?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī stands and talks together with one lay man alone in a secluded place, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>獨者，一比丘尼、一白衣男子，更無第三人。</lzh>
“Alone” means one bhikkhunī and one lay man, without a third person.

<lzh>屏處者，若壁障、若籬障、若衣障。</lzh>
“A secluded place” means concealed by a wall, concealed by a fence, or concealed by a robe.

<lzh>共立者，可疑處。</lzh>
“Standing together” means in a dubious place.

<lzh>共語者，可疑處。</lzh>
“Talking together” means in a dubious place.

<lzh>波夜提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼獨與一白衣男子屏處共立、共語，波夜提。隨共立共語，隨得爾所波夜提。(八十二竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī stands and talks together with one lay man alone in a secluded place, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she stands and talks together, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 82.)
