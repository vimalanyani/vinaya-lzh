<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時諸比丘尼，乞財物欲作尼僧坊。諸居士問言：「汝用作何等？」答言：「作比丘尼僧坊。」有信婆羅門居士多與財物。是比丘尼得財物已值世飢儉，比丘尼作是思惟：「今時儉世宜自活命。若我活者，後當作比丘尼僧坊。」即於儉世食是物盡。飢儉世過豐樂時至，諸比丘尼復行乞物欲作僧坊。諸居士問言：「用作何等？」答言：「作比丘尼僧坊。」諸居士言：「我等先所施物，今何所在？」答言：「我先乞財物已值世飢儉，我等作是思惟：『如今飢儉宜自活命，我若活者，後當作僧坊。』我等飢儉時食此物盡。」諸居士呵責言：「諸比丘尼自言：『善好有功德。』為異事乞、作異事用，如王夫人、大臣婦。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, the bhikkhunīs asked for requisites wanting to build a bhikkhunī monastery. The householders asked: “What are you going to use it for?” They answered: “To build a bhikkhunī monastery.” Faithful brahmin householders gave many requisites. When the bhikkhunīs had obtained the requisites, a famine occured in the world. The bhikkhunīs thought: “Now is a time of scarcity in the world. It’s appropriate to ensure our survival. If we survive, we’ll build a bhikkhunī monastery later.” Then during the time of scarcity in the world, they used up all the items for food. When the famine was over and a time of abundance came, the bhikkhunīs went again and asked for items, wanting to build a monastery. The householders asked: “What are you going to use it for?” They answered: “To build a bhikkhunī monastery.” The householders said: “Where are the items we’ve previously given?” They answered: “When we had asked for requisites previously, a famine occured in the world. We thought: ‘As there’s a famine now, it’s appropriate to ensure our survival. If we survive, we’ll build a monastery later.’ We used up all the items for food during the famine.” The householders criticized them: “These bhikkhunīs say of themselves: ‘We’re virtuous and have merit’, but they ask for one thing, and use it for a different purpose, like queens and wives of high officials.”

<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責：「云何名比丘尼，異乞異用？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問是比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，異乞異用？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼為僧事乞作餘事用，尼薩耆波夜提。」</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you ask for one thing, and use it for a different purpose?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked those bhikkhunīs: “Did you really do this?” They answered: “We really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized them with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called bhikkhunīs when you ask for one thing, and use it for a different purpose?” Having criticized them with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī asks for one thing for the sangha, and uses it for a different purpose, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>尼薩耆波夜提者，是物應捨，波夜提罪應悔過。</lzh>
“A nissaggiya pācittiya” means that this item should be relinquished, and the pācittiya offense should be confessed.

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼為僧事乞作餘事用，隨用隨得爾所尼薩耆波夜提。(第二十六事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī asks for one thing for the sangha, and uses it for a different purpose, then whenever she uses it, she incurs a nissaggiya pācittiya. (End of rule 26.)
