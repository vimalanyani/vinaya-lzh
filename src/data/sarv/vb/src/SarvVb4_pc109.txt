<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時偷蘭難陀比丘尼，滿十二歲已嫁女，未作屬和上尼羯磨，便畜作眾。是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責：「云何名比丘尼，滿十二歲已嫁女，未作屬和上尼羯磨，便畜作眾？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責言：「云何名比丘尼，滿十一歲已嫁女，未作屬和上尼羯磨便畜作眾？」種種因緣呵已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼，滿十二歲已嫁女，未作屬和上尼羯磨便畜作眾，波逸提。」</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, Thullanandā bhikkhunī just took on a married woman who was 12 years old as her student, when the formal act of dependence on a preceptor hadn’t been carried out yet<note> I.e. the saṅghakamma in the bhikkhunī sangha to give full ordination.</note>. 

Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you just take on a married woman who is 12 years old as your student, when the formal act of dependence on a preceptor hasn’t been carried out yet?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked her: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you just take on a married woman who is 12 years old as your student, when the formal act of dependence on a preceptor hasn’t been carried out yet?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī just takes on a married woman who is 12 years old as her student, when the formal act of dependence on a preceptor hasn’t been carried out yet, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波逸提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼，滿十二歲已嫁女，未作屬和上尼羯磨便畜作眾，波逸提。隨畜，隨得爾所波逸提。(一百九事竟)</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī just takes on a married woman who is 12 years old as her student, when the formal act of dependence on a preceptor hasn’t been carried out yet, it’s a pācittiya. Whenever she takes one on, she incurs a pācittiya. (End of rule 109.)
