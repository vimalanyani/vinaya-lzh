<h2>Origin Story</h2>

<lzh>佛在舍衛國。爾時有迦羅比丘尼先是外道，棄捨經、律、阿毘曇，誦讀種種呪術。</lzh>
The Buddha was in Sāvatthī. At that time, Kālī bhikkhunī, who had previously been a non-Buddhist renunciate, disregarded the suttas, the vinaya, and the abhidhamma, and recited all kinds of magic arts.

<lzh>是中有比丘尼，少欲知足行頭陀，聞是事心不喜，種種因緣呵責：「云何名比丘尼，棄捨經、律、阿毘曇，誦讀種種呪術？」種種因緣呵已，向佛廣說。佛以是事集二部僧，知而故問迦羅比丘尼：「汝實作是事不？」答言：「實作。世尊！」佛以種種因緣呵責：「云何名比丘尼，棄捨經、律、阿毘曇，讀誦種種呪術？」種種因緣訶已，語諸比丘：「以十利故與比丘尼結戒。從今是戒應如是說：若比丘尼，讀誦種種呪術，波逸提。」</lzh>
Among the bhikkhunīs were those of few wishes, who knew moderation and practised the austerities. When they heard of this matter, their minds weren’t pleased, and they criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you disregard the suttas, the vinaya, and the abhidhamma, and recite all kinds of magic arts?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, they explained it to the Buddha in detail. The Buddha gathered both sanghas because of this matter. He knew, and intentionally asked Kālī bhikkhunī: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha criticized her with all kinds of reasons: “How can you be called a bhikkhunī when you disregard the suttas, the vinaya, and the abhidhamma, and recite all kinds of magic arts?” Having criticized her with all kinds of reasons, he said to the bhikkhus: “For 10 benefits, I’ll lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. From now on, this precept should be recited thus: 


<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

‘If a bhikkhunī recites all kinds of magic arts, it’s a pācittiya.’”


<h2>Explanations</h2>

<lzh>波逸提者，燒煮覆障，若不悔過，能障礙道。</lzh>
“Pācittiya” means burn, cook, cover, obstruct. If she doesn’t confess the offense, it can obstruct the path. 

<lzh>是中犯者，若比丘尼讀誦種種呪術，若是偈說，偈偈波逸提；若是章說，章章波逸提；若別句說，句句波逸提。</lzh>
Herein, this is an offense: If a bhikkhunī recites all kinds of magic arts, and if she recites it in verses, each verse is a pācittiya. If she recites it in chapters, each chapter is a pācittiya. If she recites it in another form, each sentence is a pācittiyā.

<lzh>不犯者，若讀誦治齒。呪腹痛呪、治毒呪，若為守護安隱，不犯。(一百四十事竟)</lzh>
There’s no offense: If she recites a spell to cure a tooth ache or a stomach ache, to counteract poison, or for protection and safety, the offense isn’t committed. (End of rule 140.)
