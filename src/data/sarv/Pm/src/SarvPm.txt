<h2>Preliminaries</h2>


<lzh>說法章</lzh>
<h3>Section on reciting the dhamma.</h3>

<lzh>大德尼僧聽。冬時一月過少一夜。餘有一夜三月在。老死至近。佛法欲滅。</lzh>
“Venerables, may the bhikkhunī sangha listen. The first month of the winter season has already passed, except for one night. One night and three months remain. Old age and death are drawing near, and the Buddha’s dhamma will extinguish.


<lzh>第二教戒章</lzh>
<h3>Second section on teaching the precepts.</h3>

<lzh>諸大德。為得道故。一心勤精進。所以者何。諸佛一心勤精進故。得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提。何況餘善道法。</lzh>
Venerables, to realize the path, strive single-mindedly with diligence. Why? Because the Buddhas have striven single-mindedly with diligence, they’ve realized unsurpassed perfect enlightenment, let alone the other wholesome path-factors.


<lzh>第三會坐章</lzh>
<h3>Third section on assembling together.</h3>

<lzh>未受具足者已出。僧今和合。先作何事(一人答布薩說波羅提木叉)諸大德。不來諸比丘尼。說欲及清淨。</lzh>
Those who haven’t received the full ordination yet have already left. The sangha is now in harmony. What are we doing first? (One person answers: ‘The uposatha recitation of the pātimokkha.’) Venerables, announce the consent and purity of the bhikkhunīs who haven’t come.


<h2>Introductory Verses</h2>

<lzh>第四供養章</lzh>
<h3>Fourth section on veneration.</h3>

<lzh-verse>合十指爪掌　　供養釋師子
我今欲說戒　　僧當一心聽
乃至小罪中　　心應大怖畏
有罪一心悔　　後更莫復犯
心馬馳惡道　　放逸難禁制
佛說切戒行　　亦如利轡勒
佛口說教誡　　善者能信受
是人馬調順　　能破煩惱軍
若不受教勅  	亦不愛樂戒
是人馬不調　　沒在煩惱軍
若人守護戒　　如犛牛愛尾
繫心不放逸　　亦如猴著鎖
日夜常精進　　求實智慧故
是人佛法中　　能得清淨命</lzh-verse>

<verse>Joining the palms and the ten fingers together we venerate the Sakyan lion.
I now want to recite the precepts, may the sangha listen single-mindedly.

Even towards the small offenses, our hearts should feel great fear.
Having committed an offense, one should single-mindedly repent, and not transgress again later.

The horse-like mind runs down the evil paths, negligence is difficult to restrain.
The Buddha taught that we must practise the precepts, as beneficial bridle and reins.

The Buddha gave these instructions, so that the good can attain faith.
That person is like an obedient horse, that can destroy the army of defilements.

If one doesn’t receive these teachings, and doesn’t feel love and happiness towards the precepts,
That person is like an untamed horse, that will founder against the army of defilements.

If someone protects the precepts like a yak its tail,
With their mind restrained without any negligence, like a locked-up monkey,

Making an intense effort day and night to seek true wisdom,
That person can attain a pure life in the Buddha’s dhamma.</verse>


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<lzh>第五和眾章</lzh>
<h3>Fifth section on the harmonious group.</h3>

<lzh>大德尼僧聽。今十五日布薩說波羅提木叉。若僧時到僧忍聽。僧一心作布薩說波羅提木叉。如是白。</lzh>
Venerables, may the bhikkhunī sangha listen. Today is the uposatha recitation of the pātimokkha of the 15th day. If the right time has come for the sangha, may the sangha approve. The sangha single-mindedly carries out the uposatha recitation of the pātimokkha. This is the motion.


<lzh>第六淨眾章</lzh>
<h3>Sixth section on the purity of the group.</h3>

<lzh>諸大德。今共作布薩說波羅提木叉。僧一心善聽。有罪者發露。無罪者默然。默然故。當知諸大德清淨。如一一比丘尼問答。是比丘尼眾中三唱亦如是。若有比丘尼。如是比丘尼眾中第三唱。憶有罪不發露。得故妄語罪。諸大德。故妄語罪。佛說遮道法。比丘尼於此中欲求清淨。憶有罪應發露。發露則安隱。不發露罪益深。</lzh>
Venerables, now we’ll carry out the uposatha recitation of the pātimokkha together. The sangha should listen single-mindedly and attentively. Those who have an offense should disclose it. Those who don’t have an offense should remain silent. By your silence I’ll know that the venerables are pure. As though each bhikkhunī was questioned one by one, when I ask three times in the midst of this bhikkhunī sangha, it’s the same. If there’s a bhikkhunī who, when I ask like this the third time in the midst of the bhikkhunī sangha, remembers that she has an offense but doesn’t disclose it, she incurs the offense of intentional lying. Venerables, the Buddha has said that the offense of intentional lying is something that obstructs the path. A bhikkhunī who desires purification herein and remembers an offense, should disclose it. Disclosing it leads to peace. Not disclosing it increases the offense.


<lzh>諸大德。已說波羅提木叉序。今問諸大德。是中清淨不。第二第三亦如是問。是中清淨不。諸大德。是中清淨。默然故。是事如是持。</lzh>
Venerables, I’ve recited the introduction to the pātimokkha. Now I ask the venerables: ‘Are you pure herein?’ A second and a third time, I ask this. ‘Are you pure herein?’ The venerables are pure herein, therefore you’re silent. This matter is remembered thus.


<h2>Eight Pārājika Rules</h2>

<lzh>諸大德。是八波羅夷法。半月半月波羅提木叉中說。</lzh>
Venerables, these eight pārājika rules are recited every half-month in the pātimokkha.


<h3>Pārājika 1</h3>

<lzh>若比丘尼。同入比丘尼學法。不捨戒戒羸不出。行婬法乃至共畜生。是比丘尼犯波羅夷。不應共住。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī undertakes the bhikkhunī training and rules, doesn’t give up the precepts, doesn’t disclose her weakness in the precepts, and engages in sexual intercourse even together with an animal, that bhikkhunī commits a pārājika, and shouldn’t live in community.

<h3>Pārājika 2</h3>

<lzh>若比丘尼。若聚落若空地。不與取。名盜物。如不與物取故。若王若王等。若捉若殺。若縛若擯。若輸金罪。若言。汝小兒汝賊汝癡。如是相。不與物取。是比丘尼犯波羅夷。不應共住。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī in a village or an empty place takes what isn’t given, what would be called ‘stealing an item’, so that because of taking the item that wasn’t given the king or his retinue would either arrest, kill, bind, banish, or make her pay a fine in gold, and say: ‘You child, you criminal, you fool!’, if she takes the item that wasn’t given in this way, that bhikkhunī commits a pārājika, and shouldn’t live in community.

<h3>Pārājika 3</h3>

<lzh>若比丘尼。若人若似人。故自手奪命。若持刀與。若教死若讚死。作是言。人用惡活為。死勝生。隨彼心樂死。種種因緣教死讚死。是人因是事死。是比丘尼犯波羅夷。不應共住。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī takes the life of a human being or a human-like being, intentionally and with her own hands, or by giving someone a knive, or by teaching death and praising death, saying: ‘You, what use is this bad life? Death is better than living!’ and goes along with that person’s thoughts to delight in death, and with all kinds of reasons she teaches death and praises death, and if that person dies because of that, that bhikkhunī commits a pārājika, and shouldn’t live in community.

<h3>Pārājika 4</h3>

<lzh>若比丘尼。不知不見。空無過人法。自言。我如是知如是見。是比丘尼後時若問若不問。貪利養故。不知言知。不見言見。空誑妄語。除增上慢。是比丘尼犯波羅夷。不應共住。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī, not knowing and seeing, vainly, without a superhuman state, says about herself: ‘I know in this way, I see in this way’, and that bhikkhunī at a later time, whether questioned or not questioned, (says:) ‘Because of craving for gains, I, not knowing said I know, not seeing said I see. It was empty, deceited, false speech’, except in a case of superiority conceit, that bhikkhunī commits a pārājika, and shouldn’t live in community.

<h3>Pārājika 5</h3>

<lzh>若比丘尼，有漏心，聽漏心男子，髮際已下至膝腕已上，却衣順摩、逆摩、牽推、按掐、抱上、抱下，是比丘尼，犯波羅夷，不應共住。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī with a defiled mind allows a man with a defiled mind, having removed her robes, to rub her up and down below the hairline and above the wrists and the knees, to pull, push, press, and pinch her, to lift her up and set her down, that bhikkhunī commits a pārājika, and shouldn’t live in community.

<h3>Pārājika 6</h3>

<lzh>若比丘尼。有漏心聽漏心男子。捉手捉衣共立共語。共期入屏覆處。待男子來。與身如白衣女。以此八事示貪著相。是比丘尼犯波羅夷。不應共住。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī with a defiled mind allows a man with a defiled mind to hold her hand, hold her robes, stands together, talks together, makes an appointment, enters a secluded place, waits for the man to come, and gives her body, like a lay woman, if by these eight things, she shows the signs of craving and attachment, that bhikkhunī commits a pārājika, and shouldn’t live in community.

<h3>Pārājika 7</h3>

<lzh>若比丘尼。知比丘尼犯重罪。覆藏乃至一夜。是比丘尼。知彼比丘尼若退若住若滅若去。後作是言。我亦先知是比丘尼犯如是如是罪。但不欲自舉。不欲向僧說。或有人言。云何妹自污其姊。是比丘尼犯波羅夷。不應共住。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī knows that another bhikkhunī has committed a grave offense, and conceals it for even one night, and when this bhikkhunī knows that the other bhikkhunī has either disrobed, or stayed on, or been expelled, or left, and later says: ‘I already knew earlier that that bhikkhunī had committed such-and-such an offense, but I didn’t want to bring it up myself, nor tell the sangha. Maybe people would’ve said: “How can a younger sister disgrace her older sister?”’, that bhikkhunī commits a pārājika, and shouldn’t live in community.

<h3>Pārājika 8</h3>

<lzh>若比丘尼。知是比丘。一心和合僧。如法作不見擯。獨一無二。無伴無侶。不休不息。便往隨順。諸比丘尼。應如是諫是比丘尼。是比丘。一心和合僧。如法作不見擯。獨一無二。無伴無侶。不休不息。汝莫隨順是比丘。諸比丘尼如是諫時。堅持是事不捨者。諸比丘尼應第二第三諫。令捨是事故。第二第三諫時。若捨是事善。若不捨者。是比丘尼犯波羅夷。不應共住。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī knows that a bhikkhu has been expelled by a unanimous, harmonious sangha according to dhamma for not seeing (an offense), that he’s alone without a second person, without a companion, without an associate, but doesn’t stop and doesn’t desist, and she goes and follow him, the bhikkhunīs should admonish that bhikkhunī: ‘That bhikkhu has been expelled by a unanimous, harmonious sangha according to dhamma for not seeing (an offense), and he’s alone without a second person, without a companion, without an associate, but doesn’t stop and doesn’t desist. Don’t follow that bhikkhu.’ When the bhikkhunīs admonish her in this way, and she holds firmly on to this matter and doesn’t give it up, the bhikkhunīs should admonish her a second and a third time to make her give up this matter. If she gives it up at the second or third admonishment, it’s fine. If not, that bhikkhunī commits a pārājika, and shouldn’t live in community.


<lzh>諸大德。已說八波羅夷法。若比丘尼犯一一法。是比丘尼不得共住。不得共事。如前後亦如是。是比丘尼犯波羅夷。不應共住。今問諸大德。是中清淨不。第二第三亦如是問。是中清淨不。諸大德。是中清淨。默然故。是事如是持。</lzh>
Venerables, the eight pārājika rules have been recited. If a bhikkhunī has committed any of these offenses, that bhikkhunī may not live in community, and may not carry out matters together with the others. As before, so also afterwards.<note>i.e. she reverts to a lay person, as before.</note> That bhikkhunī commits a pārājika and shouldn’t live in community. Now I ask the venerables: ‘Are you pure herein?’ A second and third time, I ask this: ‘Are you pure herein?’ The venerables are pure herein, therefore you’re silent. This matter is remembered thus.


<h2>17 Saṅghādisesa Rules</h2>

<lzh>諸大德。是十七僧伽婆尸沙法。半月半月波羅提木叉中說。</lzh>

<h3>Saṅghādisesa 2</h3>

<lzh>若比丘尼惡瞋故。以無根波羅夷法。謗無波羅夷比丘尼。欲破彼梵行。是比丘尼後時若問若不問。知是事無根。是比丘尼住瞋故。作是語者。是法初犯僧伽婆尸沙可沙可悔過。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī, out of unwholesome anger, slanders a bhikkhunī who hasn’t committed a pārājika with an unfounded pārājika offense, wanting to destroy her monastic life, and if that bhikkhunī at a later time, whether questioned or not questioned, (makes it) known that that matter was unfounded, and that she said it because she was harboring anger, that act is an immediate saṅghādisesa, from which one can repent.

<h3>Saṅghādisesa 3</h3>

<lzh>若比丘尼惡瞋故。異分中取片若似片事。以波羅夷法謗。欲破彼比丘尼梵行。是比丘尼後時。若問若不問。知是片似片事。是比丘尼住瞋故。作是語者。是法初犯僧伽婆尸沙可沙可悔過。</lzh>

If a bhikkhunī says to another bhikkhunī: ‘If you don’t have a defiled mind, take food with your own hand from a man with a defiled mind, and eat it. If you use it as you want, what can that do to you?’, that act is an immediate saṅghādisesa, from which one can repent.

If a bhikkhunī wants to split the sangha in harmony, strives with skillful means, and holds on to a matter that splits the sangha, the bhikkhunīs should admonish her in this way: ‘Don’t split the sangha in harmony, strive with skillful means, and hold on to a matter that splits the sangha. You should be in harmony with the sangha. A sangha in harmony is happy and doesn’t quarrel, they’re of one mind and one training, mix like water and milk, and are able to live comfortably. You should give up pursuing a matter that splits the sangha.’ When the bhikkhunīs admonish her in this way, and she holds firmly on to this matter and doesn’t give it up, they should admonish her three more times to make her give up this matter.

If a bhikkhunī who pursues a split in the harmonious sangha has other bhikkhunīs with the same intentions helping her, one, two, or many, and they say to the other bhikkhunīs: ‘Don’t admonish that bhikkhunī in this matter. Why? That bhikkhunī speaks the dhamma, and speaks the vinaya. She doesn’t speak against the dhamma, and against the vinaya. Whatever that bhikkhunī says, we wish for. She speaks with knowledge, not without knowledge. Whatever that bhikkhunī says, we wish for, delight in, and approve of,’ the bhikkhunīs should admonish those bhikkhunīs helping her in this way: ‘Don’t say this: “That bhikkhunī speaks the dhamma, and speaks the vinaya. She doesn’t speak against the dhamma, and against the vinaya. Whatever that bhikkhunī says, we wish for. She speaks with knowledge, not without knowledge. Whatever that bhikkhunī says, we wish for, delight in, and approve of.” Don’t help to pursue a matter that splits the sangha. You should support harmony in the sangha. A harmonious sangha is happy and doesn’t quarrel, they’re of one mind and one training, mix like water and milk, and are able to live comfortably.’ When the bhikkhunīs admonish them in this way, and they hold firmly on to this matter and don’t give it up, they should admonish them three more times to make them give up this matter. If they give it up at the third admonishment, it’s fine. If not, that act is a saṅghādisesa after three admonishments, from which one can repent.

<h3>Saṅghādisesa 12</h3>

<lzh>若比丘尼。隨所依止聚落。作惡行污他家。皆見皆聞皆知。諸比丘尼應如是言。汝等作惡行污他家。皆見皆聞皆知。汝等出去。不應住此。是比丘尼語諸比丘尼言。諸比丘尼。隨愛隨瞋隨怖隨癡行。何以故。有如是同罪比丘尼。有驅者有不驅者。諸比丘尼語是比丘尼。汝莫作是語。諸比丘尼隨愛隨瞋隨怖隨癡行。何以故。諸比丘尼不隨愛瞋怖癡行。汝等作惡行污他家。皆見聞知。汝當捨是隨愛瞋怖癡語。汝等出去。不應住此。如是諫時不捨是事者。當再三諫。令捨是事故。再三諫時捨者善。不捨者。僧伽婆尸沙可沙可悔過。</lzh>
If bhikkhunīs who are supported by a village, engage in unwholesome conduct and corrupt families, and that is seen by, heard by, and known to everyone, the bhikkhunīs should speak to them in this way: ‘You engage in unwholesome conduct and corrupt families, and that is seen by, heard by, and known to everyone. Go away! You shouldn’t live here.’ If those bhikkhunīs say to the other bhikkhunīs: ‘The bhikkhunīs act out of desire, anger, fear and delusion. Why? There are also other bhikkhunīs with the same offense. Some of them are expelled, some aren’t expelled,’ the bhikkhunīs should say to those bhikkhunīs: ‘Don’t say this: “The bhikkhunīs act out of desire, anger, fear and delusion.” Why? The bhikkhunīs don’t act out of desire, anger, fear and delusion. You engage in unwholesome conduct and corrupt families, and that is seen by, heard by, and known to everyone. You should give up saying “out of desire, anger, fear and delusion”. Go away! You shouldn’t live here.’ When they admonish them in this way, and they don’t give up this matter, they should admonish them three more times to make them give up this matter. If they give it up at the third admonishment, it’s fine. If not, it’s a saṅghādisesa, from which one can repent.

<h3>Saṅghādisesa 13</h3>

<lzh>有比丘尼惡性戾語。諸比丘尼。說如法如律如戒經中事。是比丘尼戾語不受。語諸比丘尼言。汝莫語我好惡。我亦不語汝好惡。諸比丘尼應如是言。諸比丘尼。說如法如律如戒經中事。汝莫戾語當隨順語。諸比丘尼。當為汝說如法如律。汝亦當為諸比丘尼說如法如律。何以故。如是者。諸如來眾得增長利益。以共語相教共罪中出故。汝當捨是戾語事。諸比丘尼如是諫時。堅持是事不捨者。諸比丘尼當再三諫。令捨是事故再三諫時捨者善。不捨者僧伽婆尸沙可沙可悔過。</lzh>
If there’s a bhikkhunī of bad character and obstinate speech, and when the bhikkhunīs speak about matters according to dhamma, according to vinaya, according to the precepts’ sutta, that bhikkhunī speaks obstinately, doesn’t accept it, and says to the bhikkhunīs: ‘Don’t talk to me about good and bad. I also won’t talk to you about good and bad’, the bhikkhunīs should speak in this way: ‘The bhikkhunīs speak about matters according to dhamma, according to vinaya, according to the precepts’ sutta. Don’t speak obstinately. You should speak following along with us. The bhikkhunīs should speak to you according to dhamma and vinaya. You also should speak to the bhikkhunīs according to dhamma and vinaya. Why? In this way, the assemblies of the Tathāgata obtain growth and benefit, and because of talking to each other and teaching each other, they come out of offenses together. You should give up this matter of speaking obstinately.’ When the bhikkhunīs admonish her in this way, and she holds firmly on to this matter and doesn’t give it up, the bhikkhunīs should admonish her three more times to make her give up this matter. If she gives it up at the third admonishment, it’s fine. If not, it’s a saṅghādisesa, from which one can repent.

<h3>Saṅghādisesa 14</h3>

<lzh>若比丘尼，共比丘尼鬪諍時作是言：『我捨佛、捨法、捨僧、捨戒，非但沙門釋子知道，更有餘沙門、婆羅門有慚愧善好樂持戒者，我當從彼修梵行。』諸比丘尼應諫是比丘尼言：『汝莫共諸比丘尼鬪諍時作是言：「我捨佛、捨法、捨僧、捨戒，非但沙門釋子知道，更有餘沙門、婆羅門有慚愧善好樂持戒者，我當從彼修梵行。」汝應佛法中樂修梵行，當捨離自不樂心。』諸比丘尼如是諫時，堅持是事不捨者，當再三諫，令捨是事故。再三諫時捨者善；不捨者，僧伽婆尸沙可悔過。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī, while quarreling with other bhikkhunīs, says: ‘I renounce the Buddha, renounce the dhamma, renounce the sangha, and renounce the precepts. Not just the renunciates that are Sakyan children know the path. There are also other renunciates and brahmins who are conscientious, virtuous, and delight in keeping precepts. I’ll practise the monastic life with them,’ the bhikkhunīs should admonish that bhikkhunī: ‘While quarreling with other bhikkhunīs, don’t say: “I renounce the Buddha, renounce the dhamma, renounce the sangha, and renounce the precepts. Not just the renunciates that are Sakyan children know the path. There are also other renunciates and brahmins who are conscientious, virtuous, and delight in keeping precepts. I’ll practise the monastic life with them.” You should delight in practicing the monastic life in the Buddha’s dhamma, and should abandon your dissatisfied mind.’ When the bhikkhunīs admonish her in this way, and she holds firmly on to this matter and doesn’t give it up, they should admonish her three more times to make her give up this matter. If she gives it up at the third admonishment, it’s fine. If not, it’s a saṅghādisesa, from which one can repent.

<h3>Saṅghādisesa 15</h3>

<lzh>若比丘尼，共比丘尼鬪諍時作是言：『比丘尼僧隨愛行、隨瞋行、隨怖行、隨癡行。』諸比丘尼應如是諫：『汝莫共諸比丘尼鬪諍時作是言：「比丘尼僧隨愛行、隨瞋行、隨怖行、隨癡行。」何以故？比丘尼僧不隨愛、瞋、怖、癡行。汝當捨是隨愛、瞋、怖、癡語。』諸比丘尼如是諫時，堅持是事不捨者，諸比丘尼應再三諫，令捨是事故。再三諫時捨者善；不捨者，僧伽婆尸沙可悔過。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī, while quarreling with other bhikkhunīs, says: ‘The bhikkhunī sangha acts out of desire, anger, fear, and delusion,’ the bhikkhunīs should admonish her in this way: ‘While quarreling with other bhikkhunīs, don’t say: “The bhikkhunī sangha acts out of desire, anger, fear, and delusion.” Why? The bhikkhunī sangha doesn’t act out of desire, anger, fear, and delusion. You should give up this speech of following desire, anger, fear, and delusion.’ When the bhikkhunīs admonish her in this way, and she holds firmly on to this matter and doesn’t give it up, the bhikkhunīs should admonish her three more times to make her give up this matter. If she gives it up at the third admonishment, it’s fine. If not, it’s a saṅghādisesa, from which one can repent.

<h3>Saṅghādisesa 16</h3>

<lzh>若二比丘尼同心共作惡業。有惡名聲。惱比丘尼僧。互相覆罪。諸比丘尼應如是諫。汝等莫同心共作惡業有惡名聲。惱比丘尼僧。互相覆罪。汝等各別離行。別離行者增長佛法。汝等捨是隨順惡行。諸比丘尼如是諫時。堅持是事不捨者。應再三諫。令捨是事故。再三諫時捨者善。不捨者僧伽婆尸沙可沙可悔過。</lzh>
If two bhikkhunīs, with the same intentions, engage in unwholesome actions together, have a bad reputation, annoy the bhikkhunī sangha, and cover up each other’s offenses, the bhikkhunīs should admonish them in this way: ‘Don’t, with the same intentions, engage in unwholesome actions together, have a bad reputation, annoy the bhikkhunī sangha, and cover up each other’s offenses. You both should practise separately. If you practise separately, you’ll attain growth in the Buddha’s dhamma. Give up following this bad conduct.’ When the bhikkhunīs admonish them in this way, and they hold firmly on to this matter and don’t give it up, they should admonish them three more times to make them give up this matter. If they give it up at the third admonishment, it’s fine. If not, it’s a saṅghādisesa, from which one can repent.

<h3>Saṅghādisesa 17</h3>

<lzh>若比丘尼。教二比丘尼言。汝莫別離行。當同心行。別離行者不得增長。若同心行者便得增長。比丘尼僧中。亦有如汝等者。僧以瞋故。教汝別離行。諸比丘尼應如是諫。汝莫教二比丘尼作是言。汝等莫別離行。當同心行。別離行者不得增長佛法。同心行者便得增長。眾中亦有如汝等者。僧以瞋故。教汝別離行。汝當捨是勸邪行事。諸比丘尼如是諫時。堅持是事不捨者。當再三諫。令捨是事故。再三諫時捨者善。不捨者僧伽婆尸沙可沙可悔過。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī instructs two other bhikkhunīs: ‘Don’t practise separately, you should practise with the same intentions. If you practise separately, you’ll not attain growth. If you practise with the same intentions, then you’ll attain growth. There are also others like you in the bhikkhunī sangha, but out of anger, the sangha instructs you to practise separately,’ the bhikkhunīs should admonish her in this way: ‘Don’t instruct the two other bhikkhunīs: “Don’t practise separately, you should practise with the same intentions. If you practise separately, you’ll not attain growth. If you practise with the same intentions, then you’ll attain growth. There are also others like you in the sangha, but out of anger, the sangha instructs you to practise separately.” You should give up exhorting them about this wrong conduct.’ When the bhikkhunīs admonish her in this way, and she holds firmly on to this matter and doesn’t give it up, they should admonish her three more times to make her give up this matter. If she gives it up at the third admonishment, it’s fine. If not, it’s a saṅghādisesa, from which one can repent.


<lzh>諸大德。已說十七僧伽婆尸沙法。九初罪八乃至三諫。若比丘尼隨犯一一罪。應二部僧中半月行摩那埵。可二部僧意。二部僧各二十眾。應出是比丘尼罪。若二部眾中若少一人。是比丘尼罪不名為出。二部僧可呵。是法應爾。今問諸大德。是中清淨不。第二第三亦如是問。是中清淨不。諸大德。是中清淨。默然故。是事如是持。</lzh>
Venerables, the 17 saṅghādisesa rules have been recited; nine immediate offenses, and eight after the third admonishment. If a bhikkhunī has committed any of these offenses, she should undergo probation<note>Mānatta</note> for half a month before both sanghas. If it pleases both sanghas, both sanghas of 20 persons each should rehabilitate that bhikkhunī. If there’s one person less in both sanghas, that bhikkhunī can’t be called rehabilitated, and both sanghas should be criticized. This is how the procedure should be done. Now I ask the venerables: ‘Are you pure herein?’ A second and third time, I ask this: ‘Are you pure herein?’ The venerables are pure herein, therefore you’re silent. This matter is remembered thus.


<h2>30 Nissaggiya Pācittiya Rules</h2>

If a king, a king’s high official, a brahmin, or a householder sends a messenger with a robe fund for a bhikkhunī, and if that messenger comes to the bhikkhunī and says: ‘Venerable, So-and-so sends this robe fund. You should accept and take it,’ the bhikkhunī should say: ‘According to the bhikkhunī rules, I shouldn’t accept a robe fund. When I need a robe, I obtain a pure cloth. I’ll receive with my own hands, and quickly make into a robe, and keep it.’ If the messenger says to the bhikkhunī: ‘Venerable, is there a manager who can manage things for the bhikkhunīs?’, the bhikkhunī should indicate the manager, either a monastery attendant or a lay follower: ‘This person can manage things for the bhikkhunīs.’ The messenger goes to the manager and says: ‘Take this robe fund and make such-and-such a robe for bhikkhunī So-and-so. When that bhikkhunī needs a robe, you should give the robe.’ Having finished speaking, the messenger returns and tells the bhikkhunī: ‘I’ve instructed them. Venerable, when you need a robe, just go and take it. They’ll give you a robe.’ That bhikkhunī then goes to the manager and asks for the robe, saying: ‘I need a robe.’ Up to three more times, she may ask for it like this. If she obtains the robe, it’s fine. If she doesn’t obtain it, she may go and stand silently in front of the manager for a forth to a sixth time. If when she stands silently for a fourth to a sixth time, she obtains the robe, it’s fine. If she doesn’t obtain the robe, and she seeks to obtain the robe for longer, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. If she doesn’t obtain the robe, she should either go herself to the place from where the robe fund was sent, or send a messenger to say: ‘I haven’t obtained anything from the robe fund you sent. You should know that, so your things won’t be lost.’ This is how this matter should be handled.

When these three courses of action are pure, one will attain the path attained by the noble ones. 
Not retaliating when people beat and scold, with a mind without hate towards hostile people,
With a mind ever pure among hateful people, on seeing others doing evil not doing it oneself.</verse>

And having fully developed conscience and prudence, they could attain the path of nibbāna.</verse>
