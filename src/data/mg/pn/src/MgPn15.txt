<lzh>佛住舍衛城。爾時比丘尼往女人洗浴處浣月期衣。女人嫌言。是沙門尼污此水赤乃如是。諸比丘尼以是因緣往白。乃至佛言。從今日後。不聽女人洗浴處浣月期衣。若浣者越比尼罪。是名女人浣月期衣法。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying in Sāvatthī. At that time, bhikkhunīs went to the women’s bathing place to wash their menstrual cloths. The women were upset and said: “These renunciates are staining the water red like this.” For this reason the bhikkhunīs went and informed … The Buddha said: “From now on, it’s no longer allowed to wash a menstrual cloth at the women’s bathing place. If (a bhikkhunī) washes one, she breaks a minor vinaya rule.” This is called the rule on washing menstrual cloth at the women’s place.
