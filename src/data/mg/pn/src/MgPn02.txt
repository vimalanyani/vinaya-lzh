<h2>The rule on bamboo mats</h2>

<lzh>簟席法者。
佛住舍衛城。爾時比丘尼敷簟席縫衣。竹篾傷小便道血出。諸比丘尼以是因緣往白世尊。佛言。從今日後不聽比丘尼坐竹席。若縫衣時。若在講堂溫室。巨摩塗地已縫衣。若無者當敷著床上若膝上縫。若於竹簟席上坐越比尼罪。是名席法。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying in Sāvatthī. At that time, a bhikkhunī spread out a bamboo mat to sew a robe. A bamboo splinter hurt her vagina and it bled. The bhikkhunīs for this reason went and informed the World-honored One. The Buddha said: “From now on, it’s no longer allowed for a bhikkhunī to sit on a bamboo mat. When sewing a robe, she should sew it in the dhamma hall, the sauna, or in a large smoothed out area. If there are no such places, she should spread it out on the bed or on her knees to sew it. If she sits on a bamboo mat, she breaks a minor vinaya rule.” This is called the rule on bamboo mats.
