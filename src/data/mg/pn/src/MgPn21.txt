<lzh>佛住舍衛城。爾時諸比丘集。不知作舉羯磨。令比丘尼作已。比丘尼心生疑悔。語大愛道。大愛道即以是事往白世尊。佛言。此上尊眾汝云何與作舉羯磨。從今已後不聽與比丘作舉羯磨。若比丘中都無能者。得授使誦。作羯磨時若不得者遙授無罪。若比丘尼。與比丘作羯磨者越比尼罪。比丘得與比丘尼作羯磨無罪。是名羯磨。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying in Sāvatthī. At that time, the bhikkhus gathered but didn’t know how to carry out an act of suspension. After they had a bhikkhunī carry it out, the bhikkhunī became doubtful and remorseful. She told Mahāpajāpatī, and she then went and informed the World-honored One about this matter. The Buddha said: “This is the respected bhikkhu sangha. Why did you carry out an act of suspension for them? From now on, it’s no longer allowed to carry out an act of suspension for the bhikkhus. If there’s no one among the bhikkhus who can do it, she may teach them how to recite. When the formal act is carried out, if they still can’t do it, and she prompts them from a distance, there’s no offense. If a bhikkhunī carries out a formal act for bhikkhus, she breaks a minor vinaya rule. A bhikkhu may carry out a formal act for bhikkhunīs without offense. This is called the rule on formal acts.
