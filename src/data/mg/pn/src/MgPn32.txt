<lzh>佛住舍衛城。爾時比丘尼作廁。以物覆上。諸女人持死胎放中。後有賤人旃陀羅抒廁。見已言。是沙門尼自墮胎擲中。諸比丘尼以是因緣往白。乃至佛言。從今日後不聽覆廁。當開口作。若閉口作者越比尼罪。是名廁法。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying in Sāvatthī. At that time, the bhikkhunīs built a toilet with a cover. Women brought dead fetuses, and put them inside. Later, outcasts, caṇḍālas, dug out the toilet. When they saw (the fetuses), they said: “These renunciates had abortions, and threw them in.” For this reason, the bhikkhunīs went and informed … The Buddha said: “From now on, a covered toilet is no longer allowed. You should build it with an open toilet bowl. If (a bhikkhunī) builds it with a cover, she breaks a minor vinaya rule. This is called the rule on toilets.
