<lzh>佛住舍衛城。爾時比丘尼種種觸身出精。或蕪菁根葱根。種種諸根內小便道中出精。比丘尼以是因緣往白。乃至從今已後不聽若比丘尼用蕪菁根葱根內小便道中出精。以歇欲心者偷蘭遮。是名根。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying in Sāvatthī. At that time, a bhikkhunī touched the body with all kinds of things, and emitted sexual fluids. She inserted turnip roots, scallion roots, and various other roots into her vagina and emitted sexual fluids. For this reason, the bhikkhunīs went and informed … “From now on, it’s no longer allowed. If a bhikkhunī takes turnip roots or scallion roots, inserts them into her vagina, and emits sexual fluids, to relieve a lustful mind, it’s a thullaccaya.” This is called the rule on roots.
