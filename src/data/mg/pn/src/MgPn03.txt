<beginchinese>佛住舍衛城。爾時偷蘭難陀與眾多女人。到阿耆羅河脫衣洗浴。比丘尼先出。取女人莊嚴腰物纏腰已。語女人言看我好不。諸女人言。我食欲人纏腰使細。欲令夫主愛念。阿梨耶。用是何為。比丘尼聞已以。是事具白大愛道。乃至答言實爾。世尊。佛言。此是惡事。從今已後。不聽比丘尼纏腰。若用女人纏腰物纏腰越比尼罪。若有癰瘡纏腰無罪。<endchinese>

The Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī. At that time, Thullanandā went to the river Aciravatī with a large group of women. They removed their clothes and bathed. The bhikkhunī was the first to come out, and she picked up a woman’s hip ornament. Having bound it around her hips, she said to the women: “Look, do I look good?” The women said: “We’re lustful people. We bind our hips to look delicate, and because we want to make our husbands think about love. Venerable, what do you use this for?” When the bhikkhunīs heard this, they fully informed Mahāpajāpatī about this matter. … She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha said: “This is an unwholesome thing. From now on, it’s no longer allowed for a bhikkhunī to bind her hips. If she uses an item that women bind around the hips, and binds it around her hips, she breaks a minor vinaya rule. If she has an abscess and bandages her hips, there is no offense.”
