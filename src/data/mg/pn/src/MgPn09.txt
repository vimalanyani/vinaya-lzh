<lzh>佛住舍衛城。爾時有年少比丘尼。端正乳出。人見皆笑。諸比丘尼以是因緣往白佛。乃至答言實爾。佛言。從今日後。當作僧祇支。作法者如上說。應先著覆乳衣然後著餘衣。若不畜僧祇支越比尼罪。有而不著亦越比尼罪。是名僧祇支法。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying in Sāvatthī. At that time, there was a young bhikkhunī who was graceful. Her breasts were exposed, and when people saw it, they all laughed at her. The bhikkhunīs for this reason went and informed the World-honored One. … She answered: “I really did this.” The Buddha said: “From now on, you should make a vest. The method to make it’s as explained above. She should first put on a breast covering cloth, and over that wear her other robes. If she doesn’t keep a vest, she breaks a minor vinaya rule. If she has one, but doesn’t wear it, she also breaks a minor vinaya rule.” This is called the rule on vests.
