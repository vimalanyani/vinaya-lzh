<lzh>佛住舍衛城。乃至洗浴。先出著女人莊嚴服。諸比丘尼以是因緣往白世尊乃至答言實爾。佛言。從今日後。不聽著女人莊飾服。女人服者。頭上光鍱額耳鐶鈴瓔珞指鐶臂釧脚釧如是比。一切女人嚴飾服不聽著。若著者越比尼罪。若身有癰瘡。以藥塗纏無罪。是名女人嚴飾服。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī. … to bathe. (Thullanandā) came out first and put on a woman’s ornaments. The bhikkhunīs for this reason went and informed the World-honored One. … She answered: “I really did this.” The Buddha said: “From now on, it’s no longer allowed to wear women’s ornaments. ‘Women’s ornaments’ means diadems, earrings, bells, necklaces, fingerrings, bracelets for arms and legs, and similar items. All women’s ornaments may not be worn. If (a bhikkhunī) wears one, she breaks a minor vinaya rule. If she has an abscess on her body, and she applies medicine and bandages it, there is no offense.” This is called the rule on women’s ornaments.
