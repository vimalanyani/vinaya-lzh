<lzh>佛住舍衛城。爾時偷蘭難陀比丘尼乞食詣一大家。時有婦人墮胎。語言。為我棄之。答言不能。又請我當顧爾許物。即取以鉢盛之而去。時大迦葉乞食恒作此念。最初得食。當施與若比丘比丘尼。見此比丘尼已語言。取鉢來。即覆不示。又復更呼。亦復不示。大迦葉性有威風。厲聲而喚。即戰怖而示。見已言。咄汝何故作此惡法。時大迦葉語諸比丘尼。諸比丘尼。以是因緣往白世尊。乃至答言實爾。佛言。此是惡事非法。汝云何覆鉢。從今日後不聽覆鉢。復不聽露捉。得食已當覆。若見比丘時當舉覆示之。若露持鉢越比尼罪。見比丘不示亦越比尼罪。是名鉢事。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying in Sāvatthī. At that time, Thullanandā bhikkhunī reached a great house on almsround. Then there was a woman who had had a miscarriage. She said: “Throw this away for me.” (Thullanandā) said: “I can’t.” (The woman) asked again: “I’ll provide such-and-such things.” Then (Thullanandā) placed it into her bowl, and left. At that time, Mahākassapa was on a continuous almsround and thought: “The first food I obtain, I’ll give to a bhikkhu or bhikkhunī.” When he saw the bhikkhunī, he said: “Come and bring your bowl.” But she covered it, and didn’t show it to him. He called her again, but she still didn’t show it. Mahākassapa had a imposing personality, and he called out in a stern voice. Then, terrified, she showed it to him. When he saw it, he said: “Hey, why did you do this bad thing?” Then Mahākassapa told the bhikkhunīs, and for this reason, they went and informed the World-honored One … She answered: “I really did this.” The Buddha said: “This is an unwholesome thing against the dhamma. Why did you cover your bowl? From now on, it’s no longer allowed to cover one’s bowl. It’s also not allowed to carry it openly. When (a bhikkhunī) has received food, she should cover it. If she sees a bhikkhu, she should lift the cover, and show him the bowl. If she carries the bowl openly, she breaks a minor vinaya rule. If she sees a bhikkhu, and doesn’t show it to him, she also breaks a minor vinaya rule. This is called the rule on bowls.
