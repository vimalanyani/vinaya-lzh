The Lokuttaravāda parallel says: “yo bhikṣūṇām abhihāro an-abhihāro so bhikṣuṇīnāṁ” (An offering to the bhikkhus isn’t an offering to the bhikkhunīs.) “An-abhihāro” therefore isn’t a thing, and should have been translated as “isn’t an offering” instead of transliterating it.</note> aren’t for the bhikkhunīs. The bhikkhunīs’ offerings and non-offerings aren’t for the bhikkhus.
