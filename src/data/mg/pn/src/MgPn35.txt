When bhikkhus receive a kaṭhina robe, the act isn’t valid for the bhikkhunīs. When bhikkhunīs receive a kaṭhina robe, the act isn’t valid for the bhikkhus. When bhikkhus relinquish it, the act isn’t valid for the bhikkhunīs. When bhikkhunīs relinquish it, the act isn’t valid for the bhikkhus. 
The bhikkhus’ offerings and non-offerings<note>The Chinese text transliterates “abhihāra-anabhihāra”. It seems that this is a misunderstanding of the Indic text from which it was translated. The Lokuttaravāda parallel says: “yo bhikṣūṇām abhihāro an-abhihāro so bhikṣuṇīnāṁ” (An offering to the bhikkhus isn’t an offering to the bhikkhunīs.) “An-abhihāro” therefore isn’t a thing, and should have been translated as “isn’t an offering” instead of transliterating it.</note> are not for the bhikkhunīs. The bhikkhunīs’ offerings and non-offerings are not for the bhikkhus.
