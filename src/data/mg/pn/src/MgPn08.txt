<lzh>佛住舍衛城。爾時世尊制戒。不聽畜婬女。爾時比丘尼便私畜園民女。於外婬蕩以自活命。為世人所譏。此非出家法。是婬女耳。比丘尼以是因緣往白世尊。乃至答言實爾。佛言。從今日後。不聽私畜園民女。使人女作婬女以自活命。若畜者越比尼罪。是名園民女。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying in Sāvatthī. At that time, the World-honored One had laid down the precept that it’s not allowed to keep prostitutes. Then bhikkhunīs kept personal female attendants who engaged in sex outside to make a living. Lay people blamed them: “These aren’t renunciates, they’re just prostitutes.” The bhikkhunīs for this reason went and informed the World-honored One. … They answered: “We really did this.” The Buddha said: “From now on, it’s no longer allowed to keep personal attendants, or to make servant women prostitute themselves to make a living. If (a bhikkhunī) keeps one, she breaks a minor vinaya rule.” This is called the rule on female attendants.
