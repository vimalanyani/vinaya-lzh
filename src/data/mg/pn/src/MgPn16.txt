<lzh>佛住舍衛城。爾時世尊制戒。不聽女人洗處浣月期衣。便往男子洗處浣。乃至若比丘尼往男子洗處浣者越比尼罪。是名男子法。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying in Sāvatthī. At that time, the World-honored One had laid down the precept that it’s not allowed to wash a menstrual cloth at the women’s bathing place. So the bhikkhunīs went to the men’s bathing place to wash it. … “If a bhikkhunī goes to the men’s bathing place to wash one, she breaks a minor vinaya rule.” This is called the rule on the men’s place.
