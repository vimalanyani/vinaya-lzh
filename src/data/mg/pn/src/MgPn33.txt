<lzh>佛住舍衛城。爾時釋種女摩羅女於浴室中浴。時有年少入中壞其梵行。諸比丘尼語大愛道。乃至從今日後不聽入浴室。若病者得房內然火油塗而揩。若比丘尼入浴室浴者。越比尼罪。是名浴室法。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying in Sāvatthī. At that time, women from Sakyan and Mallan families bathed in bathrooms. Then young men entered there, and raped them. The bhikkhunīs told Mahāpajāpatī … “From now on, it’s no longer allowed to enter a bathroom. If (a bhikkhunī) is sick, she may light a fire in a room, apply oil, and have a massage. If a bhikkhunī enters a bathroom to bathe, she breaks a minor vinaya rule. This is called the rule on bathrooms.
