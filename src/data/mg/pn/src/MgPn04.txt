<lzh>佛住舍衛城。爾時偷蘭難陀比丘尼共眾多女人。到阿耆羅河邊。脫衣放一處入水洗浴。先出岸上著女人襏衣。語諸女人言。看我宜著不。女人言。我是俗人著此已。欲令夫主愛念。汝用著是為。諸比丘尼以是因緣往白世尊。乃至答言實爾。佛言。從今日後。不聽著襏衣。襏衣者。珂貝琉璃真珠玉金銀摩尼如是比。莊嚴陰衣不聽著。下至結縷作陰衣相。越比尼罪。若陰上有癰瘡裹者無罪。是名襏衣。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying in Sāvatthī. At that time, Thullanandā bhikkhunī went to the river Aciravatī with a large group of women. They removed their clothes, put them in one spot, and entered the water to bathe. (Thullanandā) came out first onto the riverbank, put on a woman’s lingerie, and said to the women: “Look, does this suit me?” The women said: “We’re worldly people. When we wear this, we want to make our husbands think about love. What use do you have for wearing this?” The bhikkhunīs for this reason went and informed the World-honored One. … She answered: “I really did this.” The Buddha said: “From now on, it’s no longer allowed to wear lingerie. ‘Lingerie’ means underwear decorated with shells, beryl, pearls, jade, gold, silver, gems, or any similar items may not be worn. Even if she just ties threads to make something resembling an undergarment, she breaks a minor vinaya rule. If she has an abscess on the vagina and she bandages it, there’s no offense.” This is called the rule on lingerie.
