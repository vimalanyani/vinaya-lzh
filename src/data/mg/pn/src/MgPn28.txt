<lzh>佛住舍衛城。爾時釋種女摩羅女梨車女出家。紡縷而賣為世人所嫌。此非出家人。此是賣縷人也。諸比丘尼以是因緣往白。乃至佛言。從今已後。不聽紡縷。紡縷者。劫貝縷芻摩縷憍舍耶縷舍那麻縷紡縷。賣活命者越比尼罪。若欲作漉水囊腰帶紡者無罪。是名紡縷法。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī. At that time, women from the Sakyan, Mallan, and Licchavi clans had gone forth. They spun thread and sold it. Lay people blamed them: “These aren’t renunciates, they’re just thread vendors.” For this reason, the bhikkhunīs went and informed … The Buddha said: “From now on, it’s no longer allowed to spin thread. ‘Spinning thread’ means cotton, linen, silk, sunn hemp, or hemp thread. (If a bhikkhunī) spins thread, and sells it to make a living, she breaks a minor vinaya rule. If she wants to make a water filter or a belt, and spins, there’s no offense.” This is called the rule on spinning thread.
