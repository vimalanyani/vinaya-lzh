<lzh>佛住舍衛城。爾時比丘尼度釋種女摩羅女梨車女大富家女。合嚴飾服而度出家。時諸貧家有女出門。及節會日行來皆從借賃。為世人所譏。此賃衣人非出家法。諸比丘尼以是因緣往白世尊。乃至答言實爾。佛言從今日後。不聽合女人嚴飾服度出家。當令捨已而度。捨者若女人來欲出家者。應令捨俗人嚴身具。若作是念。某時或穀貴乞食難得。或老病當須湯藥。女人少能得物。當置人家。若女人持俗嚴飾服來。合度出家者越比尼罪。是名合嚴飾服出家。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying in Sāvatthī. At that time, bhikkhunīs gave the going forth to women from the Sakyan, Mallan, and Licchavi clans, as well as from very wealthy families. They brought their ornamented dresses when they went forth. When women from poor families were getting married, they all came on the wedding day and rented (the dresses) from them. Lay people blamed them: “These are rental agents of clothes, not renunciates.” The bhikkhunīs for this reason went and informed the World-honored One. … They answered: “We really did this.” The Buddha said: “From now on, it’s no longer allowed to bring women’s ornamented dresses when going forth. One should make the candidate relinquish them, and then give the going forth. ‘Relinquishing’ means if a woman comes and wants to go forth, she should be made to relinquish lay people’s items for decorating the body. If she thinks: “At a certain time, there will be a famine, and almsfood will be hard to get, or at the time of old age and sickness, I’ll need liquid remedies and medicines. Women only rarely can obtain these things,” she should place them in someone’s house. If a woman comes with her worldly ornamented dresses, if a bhikkhunī gives her the going forth while she has them, she breaks a minor vinaya rule.” This is called the rule on bringing ornamented dresses when going forth.
