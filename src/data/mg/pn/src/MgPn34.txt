<lzh>佛住舍衛城。爾時未制戒。比丘尼阿練若處聚落中未有住處。時五百比丘尼。大愛道為上首。於王園中住。諸釋種女摩羅女年少端正。有諸年少初夜伺便欲捉比丘尼。見已乘空而去。中夜復來亦復如是。後夜復來。中有鈍根。不時入定及睡眠者。不得即去。為所侵掠。大愛道以是事往白世尊。佛言。從今日後。不聽比丘尼在阿練若處住。若四眾集竟夜說法者得住。爾時不得在屏處。若比丘尼阿練若處住者越比尼罪。是名阿練若處。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying in Sāvatthī. At that time, the precept about bhikkhunīs and the wilderness hadn’t been laid down yet. There were no residences in villages yet. Then 500 bhikkhunīs with Mahāpajāpatī as their leader were staying in the king’s park. The women from Sakyan and Mallan families were young and attractive. Young men waited for them at the beginning of the night, and wanted to get hold of the bhikkhunīs. Having seen them, the bhikkhunīs rose up in the air and left. In the middle of the night, they came back again, and (the bhikkhunīs) did the same again. At the end of the night, they came again. Among (the bhikkhunīs) were some with dull faculties, who hadn’t entered concentration in time, and were sleeping. So they then didn’t manage to leave, and were seized by force. Mahāpajāpatī went to the World-honored One, and informed him of this matter. The Buddha said: “From now on, it’s no longer allowed for a bhikkhunī to stay in the wilderness. If the four assemblies gather throughout the night to hear the dhamma, she may stay. At that time, she may not be in a secluded place. If a bhikkhunī stays in the wilderness, she breaks a minor vinaya rule. This is called the rule on the wilderness.
