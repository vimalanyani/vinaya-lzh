<h2>The rule on sitting</h2>


<lzh>佛住舍衛城。爾時比丘尼初夜後夜加趺而坐。時有蛇來入瘡門中。諸比丘尼語大愛道。大愛道以是因緣往白世尊。佛言。應與某甲藥。蛇不死而還出。即與藥而出。佛言。汝云何加趺而坐。從今已後不聽。坐法者當屈一脚以一脚跟掩瘡門。若比丘尼加趺坐越比尼罪。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī. At that time, a bhikkhunī, in the early and late parts of the night, sat down in lotus position. Then a snake came and entered her vagina. The bhikkhunīs told Mahāpajāpatī and she for this reason went and informed the World-honored One. The Buddha said: “You should give her such-and-such a medicine. The snake won’t die, but come out again.” Then they gave her the medicine, and it came out. The Buddha said: “Why did you sit down in lotus position? From now on, it’s no longer allowed. The method to sit is to bend one foot, and to cover the vagina with the heel of the other foot.” If a bhikkhunī sits down in lotus position, she breaks a minor vinaya rule.
