<beginchinese>佛住舍衛城。爾時比丘尼欲心起。作胡膠身生縛著。床脚後失火。恐燒床褥故出之。時俗人看火起。何處被燒何處不被燒。見已嫌訶。云何出家人作此惡事。諸比丘尼以是因緣往白。乃至答言實爾。佛言。從今日後。不聽作胡膠形。胡膠形者。若胡膠作若銅鉛錫白鑞若牙若蠟蜜。如是比作身生。以歇欲心者。偷蘭遮。是名胡膠形。<endchinese>

The Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī. At that time, a lustful bhikkhunī made a dildo out of gum, and attached it to the foot of her bed. Later, a fire broke out. She feared that it’d burn her bed and mat, so she brought them outside. Then lay people saw the fire that had flared up, (and thought): “Which place has been burnt, which place hasn’t been burnt?” When they saw it, they criticized her: “Why do renunciates make this unwholesome thing?” The bhikkhunīs for this reason went and informed … She answered: “I really did this.” The Buddha said: “From now on, it’s no longer allowed to make a dildo out of gum. ‘A dildo out of gum’ means making it out of gum, copper, lead, tin, pewter, ivory, beeswax, etc. If she makes a dildo like this to relieve a lustful mind, it’s a thullaccaya.” This is called the rule on dildos out of gum.
