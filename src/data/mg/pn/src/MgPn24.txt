<lzh>佛住舍衛城。爾時釋種女摩羅女梨車女貴勝家女出家善知莊嚴。有嫁女娶婦。皆借倩莊嚴。得好飲食。為世人所譏。此非出家人。是客莊嚴人耳。諸比丘尼以是因緣往白。乃至佛言。從今已後。不聽莊嚴女人。莊嚴者。梳頭莊眼粉面朱脣。著嚴飾服以自活命者越比尼罪。若有頭痛眼痛得磨著藥無罪。是名莊嚴法。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī. At that time, women from the Sakyan, Mallan, and Licchavi clans, and from aristocratic families, who had gone forth, knew well how to beautify people. Brides all came to be made up. So (the bhikkhunīs) received good food and drinks. Lay people blamed them: “These aren’t renunciates. They’re just makeup artists.” For this reason, the bhikkhunīs went and informed … The Buddha said: “From now on, it’s no longer allowed to beautify women. ‘Beautifying’ means if (a bhikkhunī) combs someone’s hair, applies eye makeup, powders their face, applies red lipstick, or makes them wear ornamented clothes, to make a living, she breaks a minor vinaya rule. If she has a headache or eye pain, she may apply and wear medicine without offense.” This is called the rule on beautification.
