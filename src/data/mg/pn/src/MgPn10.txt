<lzh>佛住毘舍離。如跋陀羅比丘尼緣中廣說。佛言。不聽裸身浴。當用浴衣。不聽裸形入河若池水中浴。當著雨衣。若裸浴越比尼罪。若避隱處無人處裸浴無罪。是名浴衣法。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying in Vesālī. To be explained in detail as in the rule about Bhaddā bhikkhunī. The Buddha said: “It’s not allowed to bathe naked. She should use a bathing robe. It’s not allowed to enter a river or a pond naked to bathe. She should wear the rains robe. If she bathes naked, she breaks a minor vinaya rule. If she bathes naked in an avoided, hidden place or a place without people, there’s no offense. This is called the rule on the bathing robe.”
