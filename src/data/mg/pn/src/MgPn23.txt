<lzh>佛住舍衛城。爾時偷蘭難陀比丘尼大乳。著一僧祇支於閣上經行。俗人遙見自相謂言。看是似如水上浮瓠。諸比丘尼以是因緣往白。乃至佛言。從今日後。當作覆肩衣。覆肩衣者。襞疊拕覆肩上。若不作不著越比尼罪。不聽比丘尼高處著一重僧祇支經行。若屏處著一重僧祇支無罪。是名僧祇支。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying in Sāvatthī. At that time, Thullanandā bhikkhunī had big breasts. Just wearing her vest, she did walking meditation on the roof of the temple building. Lay people saw her from a distance, and said to each other: “Look at this. It’s like bottle gourds floating on water.” For this reason, the bhikkhunīs went and informed … The Buddha said: “From now on, you should make a shoulder-covering robe. ‘A shoulder-covering robe’ means a cloth with pleats to spread over and cover the shoulders. If (a bhikkhunī) doesn’t make one, or doesn’t wear it, she breaks a minor vinaya rule. It’s not allowed for a bhikkhunī to do walking meditation on a high place while wearing only a one-layered vest. If she wears a one-layered vest in a secluded place, there’s no offense.” This is called the rule on vests.
