<beginchinese>佛住舍衛城。爾時釋種女摩羅女大姓家女出家。種優鉢羅華取而賣之。為世人之所譏。此非出家人。此是賣華女耳。諸比丘尼以是因緣往白世尊。乃至答言實爾。佛言。從今已後。不聽種華賣以自活命。若比丘尼種優鉢羅華以自活命者越比尼罪。為塔為供養佛故無罪。是名優鉢羅華。<endchinese>

The Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī. At that time, women from the Sakyan, Mallan, and other great clans had gone forth. They planted blue lotus flowers and sold them. Laypeople blamed them: “These aren’t renunciates, they’re just flower vendors.” For this reason, the bhikkhunīs went and informed the World-honored One … They answered: “We really did this.” The Buddha said: “From now on, it’s no longer allowed to make a living by planting and selling flowers. If a bhikkhunī makes a living by planting blue lotus flowers, she breaks a minor vinaya rule. If they’re for a stupa or an offering to the Buddha, there is no offense.” This is called the rule on blue lotus flowers.
