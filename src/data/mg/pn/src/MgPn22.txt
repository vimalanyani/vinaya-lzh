<lzh>佛住比舍離。爾時跋陀羅比丘尼。著憍奢耶衣到親里家。道路值暴雨。如視水精舉見身體。眾人圍繞欲看。於是蹲地。依止弟子在邊而障。諸比丘尼以是因緣往白。乃至答言。實爾世尊。佛言。從今已後。比丘尼不聽著憍舍耶衣。憍奢耶者有二種。一者生二者作。生者細絲。作者紡絲。著細絲憍奢耶越比尼。著紡絲越比尼心悔。比丘著無罪。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying in Vesālī. At that time, Bhaddā bhikkhunī put on a silk robe, and went to her relatives’ house. On the road, she was caught in a rainstorm. (The robe) became transparent like crystal, and her whole body was visible. A crowd of people walked around her and wanted to look at her. So she crouched down. The student depending on her stood at her side to shield her off. For this reason, the bhikkhunīs went and informed … She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha said: “From now on, it’s no longer allowed for a bhikkhunī to wear silk robes. ‘Silk’ means the two kinds: raw silk and processed silk. ‘Raw’ means fine threads. ‘Processed’ means spun thread. If she wears fine-thread silk, she breaks a minor vinaya rule. If she wears spun-thread silk, she transgresses against vinaya and should mentally repent. If a bhikkhu wears it, there’s no offense.”
