<lzh>佛住舍衛城。爾時比丘尼於急流水中浴。欲心生逆水而行失不淨。諸比丘尼以是因緣往白。乃至從今日後。不聽於急流水中逆水觸小便道。流水者。若山水若急流水。若向流逆水以歇欲心者偷蘭遮。若於急流水洗時。不得向流當背。若向流者越比尼罪。是名流水。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying in Sāvatthī. At that time, a bhikkhunī bathed in rapidly flowing water. Lust arose in her mind, and she went against the current, and emitted sexual fluids. For this reason, the bhikkhunīs went and informed … “From now on, it’s no longer allowed to go against the current in rapidly flowing water, and have it touch the vagina. ‘Flowing water’ means a mountain stream, or rapidly flowing water. If she turns towards the current, and goes against the water to relieve a lustful mind, it’s a thullaccaya. If she washes in rapidly flowing water, she may not turn towards the current. She should turn the back towards it. If she turns towards the current, she breaks a minor vinaya rule.” This is called the rule on flowing water.
