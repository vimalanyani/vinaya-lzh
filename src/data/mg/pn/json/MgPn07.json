        "佛住舍衛城。爾時釋種女摩羅女梨車女貴人女。將使人出家。使人端正。令與外人交通以自活命。為世人所譏。此非出家人。是婬女耳。諸比丘尼以是因緣往白世尊。乃至答言實爾。佛言。汝云何畜。婬女以自活命。從今日後。不聽畜婬女活命。若畜者越比尼罪。是名婬女。"

        "The Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī. At that time, women from the Sakyan, Mallan, and Licchavi clans, as well as from aristocratic families went forth with servants. The servants were graceful, so they made them associate with men from outside, to make a living. Lay people blamed them: “These aren’t renunciates, they’re just prostitutes.” The bhikkhunīs for this reason went and informed the World-honored One. … They answered: “We really did this.” The Buddha said: “Why did you keep prostitutes to make a living? From now on, it’s no longer allowed to keep prostitutes for a living. If a bhikkhunī keeps one, she breaks a minor vinaya rule.” This is called the rule on prostitutes."
