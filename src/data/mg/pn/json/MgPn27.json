        "The Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī. At that time, had laid down the precept that it’s not allowed to to plant flowers and trees. Then women from the Sakyan and Mallan clans, who had gone forth, bound and sold flower garlands to make a living. Lay people blamed them: “These aren’t renunciates, they’re just flower-garland vendors.” For this reason, the bhikkhunīs went and informed … The Buddha said: “From now on, it’s no longer allowed to bind flower garlands. ‘A garland’ means with blue lotus, mallikā-jasmine, or sumanā-jasmine flowers. If (a bhikkhunī) binds garlands, and sells them to make a living, she breaks a minor vinaya rule. If during the great festivals for the Buddha’s birthday, for his awakening, for the turning of the wheel of dhamma, for Ānanda, for Rāhula, or the great festival every five years, a supporter says: ‘Venerables, help me bind garlands’, then she may bind all kinds of garlands without offense.” This is called the rule on binding garlands."
