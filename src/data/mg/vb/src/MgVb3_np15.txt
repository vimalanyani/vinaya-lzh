“A bhikkhunī” is as explained above. “A robe” means a woolen robe, a cotton robe, a silk robe, a linen robe, a sunn hemp robe, a hemp robe, and a robe woven with linen. “Storing” means storing more than the maximum is a nissaggiya pācittiya. “A nissaggiya pācittiya” is as explained above. A bhikkhunī may keep 20 robes: five determined robes, and 15 robes for use after having made a pure offering<beginnote>Pāli: vikappana. This differs from the Pāli tradition, where items are placed under vikappana to be stored, and may not be used before vikappana has been lifted.<endnote>. If she keeps more, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. A bhikkhu may keep an unlimited number as pure offerings, and use them without offense. This is what the World-honored One said.
