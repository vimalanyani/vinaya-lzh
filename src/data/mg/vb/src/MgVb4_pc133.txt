<h2>Origin Story</h2>


<lzh>佛住王舍城。爾時樹提比丘尼隱處生癰。諸比丘尼入聚落乞食。後有治癰師來。比丘尼言。長壽。與我破癰。答言可爾。即與破癰瘡。著塗藥已而去。諸比丘尼乞食還。見地膿血問言。此是何等膿血。答言。我破癰瘡。諸比丘尼嫌言。汝云何隱處有癰。不白善比丘尼而破。
諸比丘尼語大愛道。乃至答言。實爾世尊。佛言。汝云何膝以上肩以下有癰瘡。先不白聽而破癰。從今已後不聽。乃至已聞者當重聞</lzh>

The Buddha was staying in Rājagaha. At that time, Jetā bhikkhunī had developed an abscess in a hidden place. The other bhikkhunīs went to the village on almsround. Afterwards, a doctor came to treat the abscess. The bhikkhunī said: “Long-lived One, open this abscess for me.” He said: “Okay.” Then he opened the abscess, applied medicine, and left. When the other bhikkhunīs returned from almsround, they saw pus and blood on the ground, and asked: “Why is there this pus and blood?” She answered: “I had an abscess opened.” The bhikkhunīs were upset and said: “Why did you have an abscess in a hidden place opened without informing a virtuous bhikkhunī?”
The bhikkhunīs told Mahāpajāpatī, … She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha said: “Why did you, when you had an abscess above the knees, below the shoulders, have it opened without first informing someone, and being permitted? From now on, it’s no longer allowed.” … Those who have already heard it should listen again:




<h2>Final Ruling</h2>


<lzh>若比丘尼。膝以上肩以下隱處有癰瘡。先不白聽男子破洗者波夜提。</lzh>

If a bhikkhunī has an abscess in a hidden place above the knees, below the shoulders, and without first informing someone and being permitted, has a man open and wash it, it’s a pācittiya.”




<h2>Explanation</h2>


<lzh>比丘尼者如上說。膝已上者髀已上。肩已下者乳房已下。先不白者不白善比丘尼。聽者不僧中作求聽羯磨。隱處有癰欲破癰者。應先僧中作求聽羯磨。</lzh>

“A bhikkhunī” is as explained above. “Above the knees” means above the thighs. “Below the shoulders” means below the breasts. “Without first informing” means without informing a virtuous bhikkhunī. “(Not) permitted” means without carrying out the formal act to request permission in the sangha. If she has an abscess in a hidden place, and wants to open it, she should first carry out a formal act to request permission in the sangha.




<h2>Saṅghakamma</h2>


<lzh>羯磨者應作是說。阿梨耶僧聽。某甲比丘尼隱處有癰。若僧時到僧某甲比丘尼。欲從僧乞破癰羯磨。阿梨耶僧聽。某甲比丘尼。欲從僧乞破癰羯磨。僧忍默然故。是事如是持。</lzh>

The master of ceremony should say: “May the noble sangha listen. The bhikkhunī So-and-so has an abscess in a hidden place. If the right time has come for the sangha, So-and-so wants to ask the sangha for the formal act to open the abscess. May the noble sangha listen. The bhikkhunī So-and-so wants to ask the sangha for the formal act to open the abscess. The sangha accepts this, therefore you’re silent. This matter is remembered thus.” 




<h2>Explanation (continued)</h2>


<lzh>若隱處有癰者。當令可信人若依止弟子若同和上阿闍梨以錐若指甲破之以藥塗。若使男子破癰波夜提。波夜提者如上說。若肩已上膝已下有癰瘡。若欲刺頭出血。若欲刺臂。當使婦女人急按男子破無罪。是故世尊說。</lzh>

If she has an abscess in a hidden place, she should have a trustworthy person—either student who depends on her, or someone who has the same preceptor or teacher as her—open it with an awl, or with the fingernails, and apply medicine. If she has a man open the abscess, it’s a pācittiya. “Pācittiya” is as explained above. If she has an abscess above the shoulders or below the knees, or if she wants to cut her head to draw blood, or if she wants to cut her arms, then if she has a lay woman forcefully press her, and a man open it, there’s no offense. This is what the World-honored One said.
