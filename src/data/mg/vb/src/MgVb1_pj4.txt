<h2>Final Ruling</h2>


<lzh>若比丘尼未知未了。自稱得過人法。聖知見殊勝如是知如是見。彼於後時若撿挍若不撿挍犯罪。欲求清淨故便作是言。阿梨耶我不知言知不見言見空誑不實語除增上慢。是名比丘尼波羅夷不應共住。</lzh>

If a bhikkhunī, not yet knowing and understanding, claims to have attained a superhuman state, noble extraordinary knowledge and vision: “I know in this way, I see in this way,” and at a later time, whether she’s being examined or not examined about committing the offense, desiring purification, she says: “Venerables, I, not knowing said I know, not seeing said I see. It was empty, false, untrue speech,” except in a case of superiority conceit, that bhikkhunī is pārājika, and shouldn’t live in community.
