<h2>Origin Story</h2>


<lzh>佛住舍衛城。爾時偷蘭難陀比丘尼在聚落中住。為僧勸化索床褥。語婦人言。優婆夷。汝當施僧床褥枕拘執。時婦人信心歡喜。即與床褥枕拘執直。得已持作衣鉢飲食湯藥。時比丘尼次行乞食到其家。諸婦人問言。阿梨耶。我與偷蘭難陀比丘尼床褥拘執枕直。為作未。比丘尼言。那得作。但自買衣鉢飲食湯藥。
諸比丘尼聞已語大愛道。大愛道即以是事往白世尊。佛言。喚偷蘭難陀比丘尼來。來已佛問言。汝實索床褥拘執而作餘用耶。答言實爾。佛言。此是惡事。汝常不聞我無量方便毀訾多欲稱歎少欲。汝云何作惡不善法。此非法非律非如佛教。不可以是長養善法。從今日後。不聽為床褥乞轉作餘用。佛告大愛道瞿曇彌。依止舍衛城比丘尼皆悉令集。乃至已聞者當重聞。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying in Sāvatthī. At that time, Thullanandā bhikkhunī was staying in a village. She encouraged people to donate, and requested beds and mats for the sangha. She said to some women: “Laywomen, you should give beds, mats, pillows, and blankets to the sangha.” Then the women rejoiced with faith in their minds, and gave funds for beds, mats, pillows, and blankets. When Thullanandā had received them, she took them and used them for robes, bowls, drinks, food, liquid remedies, and medicines. Then when a bhikkhunī next went to that house on almsround, the women asked her: “Venerable, we gave Thullanandā bhikkhunī funds for beds, mats, blankets, and pillows. Has that been arranged yet?” The bhikkhunī said: “How could it have been arranged? She just bought robes, bowls, drinks, food, liquid remedies, and medicines for herself.”
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, they told Mahāpajāpatī, and she went to the World-honored One, and informed him of this matter. The Buddha said: “Summon Thullanandā bhikkhunī.” When she came, he asked her: “Did you really ask for beds, mats, and blankets, and then arranged for them to be used differently?” She answered: “I really did this.” The Buddha said: “This is an unwholesome thing. Have you not often heard me with countless skillful means criticize having many wishes and praise having few wishes? Why did you do this bad, unwholesome thing? This is against the dhamma, against the vinaya, against the Buddha’s teaching. One can’t develop in wholesome states like this. From now on, it’s no longer allowed to ask for beds and mats and arrange for them to be used differently.” The Buddha told Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī: “Convene all the bhikkhunīs living in the vicinity of Sāvatthī. … Those who have already heard it should listen again:




<h2>Final Ruling</h2>


<lzh>若比丘尼為床褥乞。而自作衣鉢飲食疾病湯藥者。尼薩耆波夜提。</lzh>

If a bhikkhunī asks for beds and mats, but then herself exchanges them for robes, bowls, drinks, food, or liquid remedies and medicines for the sick for herself, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.”

“A bhikkhunī” is as explained above. “Beds, mats, pillows, and blankets” are as explained in detail above in the bhikkhu rules. “Asking” means encouraging to donate, and requesting. Later exchanging them for robes, bowls, drinks, food, liquid remedies, and medicines for her own use is a nissaggiya pācittiya. “A nissaggiya pācittiya” means that the item should be relinquished in the midst of the sangha, and the pācittiya should be confessed. If she doesn’t relinquish the item but confesses, she breaks a minor vinaya rule. “A pācittiya” is as explained in detail in the bhikkhu rules. If a bhikkhunī asks for beds and mats, and then exchanges them for robes, bowls, drinks, food, liquid remedies, and medicines for her own use, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. If she asks for one thing, it’s not allowed to use it for another purpose. If she asks for a bed, and exchanges it for a mat; or if she asks for a mat, and exchanges it for a pillow; or if she asks for a pillow, and exchanges it for a blanket, she breaks a minor vinaya rule. If she encourages donations and asks, and receives many funds for beds, mats, and pillows, she should keep records of each person’s contribution: “This is a bed fund, this is a mat fund, this is a pillow fund, this is a blanket fund.” If she doesn’t do this, she breaks a minor vinaya rule for each case. She’s allowed to lend it out to manage the monastery, even just for buying pots and pans, if the loan is used according to dhamma. If a bhikkhu asks for beds and mats, and uses them for something else, he breaks a minor vinaya rule. He’s allowed to lend it out for a use according to dhamma. This is what was said.
