<h2>Origin Story</h2>


<lzh>佛住舍衛城。爾時佛告大愛道。如來一時在舍衛城。時六群比丘尼。酥市乞酥。油市乞油。蜜市乞蜜。石蜜市乞石蜜。肉市乞肉。魚市乞魚。乳市乞乳。酪市乞酪。而食為世人所譏。云何沙門瞿曇稱歎少欲毀呰多欲。如比丘緣中廣說。瞿曇彌比丘尼亦應如是學。瞿曇彌。我一時住迦維羅衛釋氏精舍。聽病比丘尼索好食。佛告大愛道瞿曇彌。依止舍衛城比丘尼皆悉令集。乃至已聞者當重聞。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī. At that time, the Buddha told Mahāpajāpatī: “One time, the Tathāgata was at Sāvatthī. Then the group-of-six bhikkhunīs asked for ghee at the ghee market, for oil at the oil market, for honey at the honey market, for sugar at the sugar market, for meat at the meat market, for fish at the fish market, for milk at the milk market, for curd at the curd market, and ate it. Lay people blamed them: ‘Why does the renunciate Gotama praise fewness of wishes and criticizes having many wishes?’ To be explained in detail as in the bhikkhus’ analysis. Gotamī, the bhikkhunīs should therefore also train as follows. Gotamī, one time when I was staying in Kapilavatthu in the Sakyan monastery, I allowed sick bhikkhunīs to ask for good food.” The Buddha told Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī: “Convene all the bhikkhunīs living in the vicinity of Sāvatthī. … Those who have already heard it should listen again:




<h2>Final Ruling</h2>


<lzh>若比丘尼不病為身白衣家乞酥。若使人乞。若噉若食。是比丘尼應向餘比丘尼悔過。如是言。阿梨耶。我墮可訶法。此法悔過。是波羅提提舍尼法。
如是二油三蜜四石蜜五乳六酪七魚八肉。</lzh>

If a bhikkhunī who isn’t sick asks a lay person for ghee, or has others ask, to chew or to eat for herself, that bhikkhunī should confess to the other bhikkhunīs: ‘Venerables, I’ve fallen into an offense to be criticized. I confess this offense.’ This is a pātidesanīya rule.
In the same way: 2. oil; 3. honey; 4. sugar; 5. milk; 6. curd; 7. fish; 8. meat.




<h2>Explanation</h2>


<lzh>為身者。自為向身。病者世尊說無罪。云何病。老羸病服吐下藥刺頭出血如是比病。家者。四種姓家。酥者。牛酥水牛酥羊酥。乞者若自乞若使人乞。若噉若食者。是比丘尼應向餘比丘尼悔過言。阿梨耶。我墮可訶法。此法悔過。前人應問。汝見此罪不。答言見。汝莫更作我頂戴持。波羅提提舍尼者。此罪應發露。是名悔過。</lzh>

“For herself” means towards her own body. “Sick” means that the World-honored One has said that there’s no offense. What is “sick”? Old, weak sick, taking medicine to induce vomiting or a laxative, taking medicine, having cut her head and bleeding, and similar sicknesses. “A family” means the four classes. “Ghee” means ghee from cows, water buffaloes, and goats. “Asking” means asking herself or having others ask. “Chewing or eating” means that that bhikkhunī should confess to the other bhikkhunīs: “Venerables, I’ve fallen into an offense to be criticized. I confess this offense.” The leader should ask: “Do you see this offense?” She should answer: “I see it.” “Don’t do it again.” “I’ll keep it respectfully.” “A pātidesanīya” means that this offense should be revealed; this is called “confession.” 


<lzh>若比丘尼熱病。須酥者得乞。不得到不信家乞。當至有信家。若乞食時見量酥人言。長壽無病。答言。阿梨耶欲得何物。答言乞食。主人言。我無食正有酥。須酥者與。得取滿鉢。亦得勸與餘人。量油亦得如是。</lzh>

If a bhikkhunī has a fever and needs ghee, she may ask for it. She may not go to a faithless household to ask for it. She should go to a faithful household. If when she’s on almsround, she sees someone who measures ghee, she should ask: “Long-lived One, are you free from sickness?” They answer: “Venerable, what to you wish to get?” She answers: “I’m on almsround.” The master says: “I don’t have food, but I certainly have ghee. If you need ghee, I’ll give some.” Then she may take a bowlful, and she may also advise them to give to other people as well. For someone measuring oil, she may also do it like this.


<lzh>若風病起亦得乞油。不得從壓油家索。應從有信家索。若乞食見量油人。當言無病長壽。言阿梨耶。欲須何物。答言乞食。我無食正有油。須者當與。得取滿鉢無罪。當時亦得勸與伴如是蜜。</lzh>

If she has a wind disorder, she may also ask for oil. She may not ask from an oil-pressing house. She should ask from a faithful household. If when she’s on almsround, she sees someone who measures oil, she should ask: “Long-lived One, are you free from sickness?” They answer: “Venerable, what to you need?” She answers: “I’m on almsround.” (They say:) “I don’t have food, but I certainly have oil. If you need it, I’ll give some.” Then she may take a bowlful without offense. And she may also advise them to give to her companion. The same for honey.


<lzh>若水病時得乞蜜。不得至採蜜家索。當到有信家乞。乃至得勸與伴如是石蜜。</lzh>

If she has a water disorder, she may ask for honey. She may not go to a honey-gathering house to ask. She should go to a faithful household to ask. … And she may also advise them to give to her companion. The same for sugar.


<lzh>若病。醫言應服石蜜。得乞石蜜。不得至石蜜家乞。當到有信家。若乞食時。見稱石蜜人。乃至得勸與伴。</lzh>

If she’s sick, and a doctor has said: “You should take sugar,” she may ask for sugar. She may not go to a sugar house to ask. She should go to a faithful household. If when she’s on almsround, she sees someone who weighs sugar, … And she may also advise them to give to her companion.


<lzh>若病。醫言當服乳。得乞乳。若乞食時見放牛家［穀－禾＋牛］乳。應言長壽無病。言阿梨耶。欲得何物。言我乞食。答言我無食正有乳。須者得取。若索酪漿。言無有酪漿正有乳得取。</lzh>

If she’s sick, and a doctor has said: “You should take milk,” she may ask for milk. If when she’s on almsround, she sees someone milking cows at a cattle farm, she should ask: “Long-lived One, are you free from sickness?” They answer: “Venerable, what to you wish to get?” She answers: “I’m on almsround.” They answer: “I don’t have food, but I certainly have milk. If you need it, you may take some.” If she asks for churned milk and they say: “I don’t have churned milk, but I certainly have milk,” she may take some.


<lzh>若病。醫言當須酪得乞酪。若乞食時見量酪人語言。長壽無病。問言阿梨耶。欲得何物。答言我乞食。若言我無食正有酪得取。亦得勸與伴。若乞酪下清汁。與酪者得取。</lzh>

If she’s sick, and a doctor has said: “You should take curd,” she may ask for curd. If when she’s on almsround, she sees someone measuring curd, she should ask: “Long-lived One, are you free from sickness?” They answer: “Venerable, what to you wish to get?” She answers: “I’m on almsround.” If they say: “I don’t have food, but I certainly have curd,” she may take some, and she may also advise them to give to her companion. If she asks for the clear liquid from curd, and they give curd, she may take it.


<lzh>若比丘尼服吐下藥。醫言當須魚汁得乞。若乞食時乞酪漿得魚者得取。</lzh>

If a bhikkhunī is taking medicine to induce vomiting or a laxative, and a doctor has said: “You should take the liquid from fish,” she may ask for it. If when she’s on almsround, she asks for churned milk and receives fish, she may take it.


<lzh>若刺頭出血。醫言須肉得乞。不得至屠兒家乞。當詣有信家乞。若乞食時得索菜汁。若言無菜汁正有肉汁。須者得取。</lzh>

If she has cut her head and is bleeding, and a doctor has said: “You need meat,” she may ask for it. She may not go to a butcher to ask. She should go to a faithful household to ask. If she’s on almsround, she may ask for vegetable broth. If they say: “I don’t have vegetable broth, but I certainly have meat broth,” she may take it if she needs it. 


<lzh>若自知我某時常病發。爾時藥必難得。得預乞無罪。若不病時乞病時食越比尼罪。病時乞不病時食無罪。病時乞病時食無罪。不病時乞不病時食波羅提提舍尼。不隨病煮隨病食無罪。隨病煮不隨病食越比尼罪。隨病煮隨病食無罪。不隨病煮不隨病食。出家人仰他活命無罪。是故世尊說。</lzh>

If she knows: “At a certain time, I’m often sick, and at that time, medicine is hard to get,” she may ask for in in advance without offense. If when she’s not sick, she asks for the time of sickness, and eats it, she breaks a minor vinaya rule. If when she’s sick, she asks for the time of health, and eats it, there’s no offense. If when she’s sick, she asks for the time of sickness, and eats it, there’s no offense. If when she’s not sick, she asks for the time of health, and eats it, it’s a pātidesanīya. If she doesn’t cook (special food) for the illness, but eats it for the illness, there’s no offense. If she cooks for the illness, but doesn’t eat it for the illness, she breaks a minor vinaya rule. If she cooks for the illness, and eats it for the illness, there’s no offense. If she doesn’t cook for the illness, and doesn’t eat it for the illness, there’s no offense, because renunciates depend on others to live. This is what the World-honored One said.


<lzh>酥油蜜石蜜乳酪肉魚是名八。比丘尼波羅提提舍尼法竟。</lzh>

Ghee, oil, honey, sugar, milk, curd, meat, fish, these are called the eight things. The bhikkhunī pātidesanīya rules are finished.
