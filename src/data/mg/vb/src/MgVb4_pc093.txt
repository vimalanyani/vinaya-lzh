<h2>Origin Story</h2>


<lzh>佛住舍衛城。爾時世尊制戒。不得減十二雨畜弟子。時六群比丘尼及餘比丘尼。滿十二雨十法不滿。畜弟子不教誡猶如天牛天羊。乃至不知著衣持鉢。
諸比丘尼以是因緣語大愛道。乃至答言。實爾世尊。佛言。從今已後。不聽十法不具足而畜弟子。佛告大愛道瞿曇彌。依止舍衛城住比丘尼皆悉令集。乃至已聞者當重聞。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī. At that time, the World-honored One had laid down the precept that isn’t allowable to take on a student when one has less than 12 rains. Then bhikkhunīs of the group-of-six and other bhikkhunīs, who had 12 full rains, but didn’t fulfill the 10 requirements, took on students. They didn’t teach and instruct them, and they were like heavenly cows and goats, … they didn’t know how to wear the robes and hold the bowl.
The bhikkhunīs informed Mahāpajāpatī of this matter. … They answered: “We really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha said: “From now on, it’s no longer allowed for someone who doesn’t fulfill the 10 requirements to take on students.” The Buddha told Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī: “Convene all the bhikkhunīs living in the vicinity of Sāvatthī. … Those who have already heard it should listen again:




<h2>Final Ruling</h2>


<lzh>若比丘尼滿十二雨。十法不具足而畜弟子者波夜提。</lzh>

If a bhikkhunī who has 12 full rains but who doesn’t fulfill the 10 requirements takes on a student, it’s a pācittiya.”




<h2>Explanation</h2>


<lzh>比丘尼者如上說。滿十二雨者如上說。十法不具足者十法不成就。何等十。一持戒。二多聞阿毘曇。三比尼。四學戒。五學定。六學慧。七能自出罪。能使人出罪。八弟子親里欲罷道。能自送若使人送至他方。九能看弟子病若使人看。十滿十二雨若過。是名十法。若十法不滿度弟子越比尼罪。受具足波夜提。若比丘十法不具足度人越比尼罪。是故世尊說。</lzh>

“A bhikkhunī” is as explained above. “Twelve full rains” is as explained above. “Not fulfilling the 10 requirements” means that the 10 requirements are not complete. Which 10? 1: Keeping precepts. 2: Having learned much of the abhidhamma. 3: And of the vinaya. 4: Training in the precepts. 5: Training in samādhi. 6: Training in wisdom. 7: Can clear offenses herself, and can help others to clear offenses. 8: When a student or a relative wants to disrobe, she’s able to either go to them herself or to send someone. 9: Is able to look after sick students or have others look after them. 10: Has 12 full rains or more. These are called the 10 requirements. If someone who doesn’t fulfill the 10 requirements gives the going forth to a student, she breaks a minor vinaya rule. If she gives the full ordination, it’s a pācittiya. If a bhikkhu who doesn’t fulfill the 10 requirements gives the going forth to someone, he breaks a minor vinaya rule. This is what the World-honored One said.
