<lzh>佛住舍衛城。爾時比丘尼著上下衣。來禮世尊足。後失火燒衣。諸比丘尼語大愛道。大愛道即以是事往白世尊。佛言。喚是比丘尼來。來已問言。汝實爾不。答言實爾。佛言。汝云何所受持衣而不隨身。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī. At that time, a bhikkhunī wearing her upper and lower robes came to pay respect at the World-honored One’s feet. Afterwards a fire broke out, and burned her (saṅghāṭī) robe. The bhikkhunīs told Mahāpajāpatī, and she went to the World-honored One, and informed him of this matter. The Buddha said: “Summon that bhikkhunī.” When she came, the Buddha asked her: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this.” The Buddha said: “Why did you not take your determined robes with you?

<lzh>從今日後。不聽所受持衣而不隨身。</lzh>

At another time, there were bhikkhunīs from the Sakyan and Mallan clans who originally came from wealthy families. Having gone forth, their saṅghāṭīs were too heavy, they couldn’t bear it, and they suffered much. … The Buddha said: “From now on, it’s allowed if one is sick.” The Buddha told Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī: “Convene all the bhikkhunīs living in the vicinity of Sāvatthī. … Those who have already heard it should listen again:




<h2>Final Ruling</h2>


<lzh>若比丘尼不病。所受衣不隨身者波夜提。</lzh>

If a bhikkhunī who isn’t sick doesn’t take her determined robes with her, it’s a pācittiya.”




<h2>Explanation</h2>


<lzh>比丘尼者如上說。所受衣者僧伽梨欝多羅僧安陀會。僧祇支雨浴衣。病者世尊說無罪。不隨身者波夜提。波夜提者如上說。若比丘尼不病。所受持衣不持者。波夜提。若禮塔若經行。若晝日坐禪處界內無罪。是故世尊說。</lzh>

“A bhikkhunī” is as explained above. “Determined robes” means saṅghāṭī, uttarāsaṅga, antaravāsaka, saṅkacchika, and rains bathing robe. “Sick” means that the World-honored One said that she’s without offense. When not taking it with her, it’s a pācittiya. “Pācittiya” is as explained above. If a bhikkhunī who isn’t sick doesn’t keep her determined robes with her, it’s a pācittiya. If she pays respect at a stupa, does walking meditation, or does sitting meditation within the territory during daytime, there is no offense. This is what the World-honored One said.
