<h2>Origin Story</h2>


<lzh>佛住舍衛城。爾時偷蘭難陀比丘尼僧伽梨破。不浣染補治。擲棄牆下作是言。若欲取者便取。時樹提比丘尼著破衣。餘比丘尼言。阿梨耶。可取持此衣浣染補治受用。即取補治浣染而著。偷蘭難陀比丘尼言。還我衣來。語諸比丘尼言。異事試看。是衣物都不得放地須臾捨去。汝屋中得滿未。即奪取僧伽梨。
諸比丘尼語大愛道。大愛道即以是事往白世尊。佛言。呼是比丘尼來。來已佛問言。汝實爾不。答言實爾世尊。佛言。此是惡事。乃至佛告大愛道瞿曇彌。依止舍衛城住比丘尼皆悉令集。乃至已聞者當重聞。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying in Sāvatthī. At that time, Thullanandā bhikkhunī’s saṅghāṭī was torn, and she didn’t wash, dye, or repair it. She threw it down by a wall, and said: “If someone wants to take it, just take it.” At that time, Jetā bhikkhunī wore torn robes. The other bhikkhunīs said: “Venerable, you can take this robe, wash, dye, and repair it, and then use it.” Then she took it, repaired, washed and dyed it, and wore it. Thullanandā bhikkhunī said: “Give back my robe.” And she said to the other bhikkhunīs: “The situation is different. I was just trying to see (what would happen). One can’t put a robe or an item on the ground, leave them for a moment, and go away. Have you been able to fill up your rooms (with robes) yet?” Then she took the saṅghāṭī back by force.
The bhikkhunīs told Mahāpajāpatī, and she went to the World-honored One, and informed him of this matter. The Buddha said: “Summon that bhikkhunī.” When she came, he asked her: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha said: “This is an unwholesome thing. … ” The Buddha told Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī: “Convene all the bhikkhunīs living in the vicinity of Sāvatthī. … Those who have already heard it should listen again:




<h2>Final Ruling</h2>


<lzh>若比丘尼於住止處。棄故僧伽梨唱言。有欲取者取。後還奪者尼薩耆波夜提。</lzh>

If a bhikkhunī throws away an old saṅghāṭī at a dwelling place, and announces: ‘If someone wants to take it, take it,’ and afterwards takes it back by force, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.”




<h2>Explanation</h2>


<lzh>比丘尼者如上說。住處者精舍內。棄者放捨在地。人取已後還奪者尼薩耆波夜提。尼薩耆波夜提者如上說。若比丘尼棄物已。有人取用不得還奪。若無人取後須用而取者無罪。若比丘精舍內。棄衣鉢革屣及餘小小物。人取已後還奪者越比尼罪。若無人取後還取者無罪。是故世尊說。</lzh>

“A bhikkhunī” is as explained above. “A dwelling place” means inside the monastery. “Throwing away” means putting or abandoning it on the ground. If she takes it back by force after someone has taken it, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. “A nissaggiya pācittiya” is as explained above. If a bhikkhunī has thrown things away, and someone has taken and used it, it’s not allowed to take it back by force. If nobody has taken it, and she later needs to use it and takes it, there’s no offense. If a bhikkhu, inside a monastery, throws robes, bowls, leather sandals, or any other minor items away, someone takes it, and he later takes it back by force, he breaks a minor vinaya rule. If nobody takes it, and he later takes it back, there’s no offense. This is what the World-honored One said.
