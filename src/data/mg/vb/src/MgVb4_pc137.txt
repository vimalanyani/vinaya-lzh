<h2>Origin Story</h2>


<lzh>佛住舍衛城。爾時迦梨比丘尼。到欲安居時餘行去。受安居已還。房舍已分竟。方來索言。是我房舍還我。住者言我已受不可得。於是鬪諍。有善比丘尼呼言。阿梨耶。可就此房住。入已持巨摩柴草積聚房中。先住者言。阿梨耶。此不用物不須安。即言賢善。汝買得此房耶。答言。我當次得此僧房。若是僧房者我何以不安。於是以身口擾亂。
諸比丘尼以是因緣往白世尊。乃至答言。實爾。佛言。此是惡事。汝云何知他先安居已後來擾亂。從今已後不聽。乃至已聞者當重聞。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying in Sāvatthī. At that time, Kālī bhikkhunī wandered to another place when it was time for the rains retreat. She returned when the rains retreat had begun, and the rooms had already been allocated. She approached (a bhikkhunī) and requested: “This is my room. Return it to me.” (The bhikkhunī) staying there said: “It has already been allocated to me. You can’t have it.” Then they started to quarrel. A virtuous bhikkhunī called out: “Venerable, you may stay in (my) room.” (Kālī) entered, and brought a large amount of fire sticks and grass which she heaped up in the middle of the room. (The bhikkhunī) who had stayed there first said: “Venerable, these things we don’t use don’t need to be kept here.” Then (Kālī) replied: “Venerable, did you buy this room?” She answered: “I got this sangha room according to seniority.” (Kālī said:) “If this is a sangha room, then why can’t I keep (my things) here?” And she disturbed the other like this by body and speech.
For this reason, the bhikkhunīs went and informed the World-honored One. … She answered: “I really did this.” The Buddha said: “This is an unwholesome thing. Why did you, knowing that another has entered the rains retreat first, arrive later and disturb her? From now on, it’s no longer allowed. … Those who have already heard it should listen again:




<h2>Final Ruling</h2>


<lzh>若比丘尼。知比丘尼先安居已後來。若自擾亂。若使人擾亂波夜提。</lzh>

If a bhikkhunī knows that another bhikkhunī has entered the rains retreat first, arrives later, and either disturbs her herself, or has others disturb her, it’s a pācittiya.”




<h2>Explanation</h2>


<lzh>知先安居者。前安居後安居。擾亂者。若自身口。若使他身口擾亂波夜提。若擾亂比丘尼波夜提。式叉摩尼沙彌尼越比尼罪。乃至俗人越比尼心悔。是故世尊說。</lzh>

“Knowing that (another bhikkhunī) has entered the rains retreat first” means the first rains retreat, or the second rains retreat. “Disturbing” means either disturbing her herself by body and speech, or having others disturb her by body and speech; this is a pācittiya. If she disturbs a bhikkhunī, it’s a pācittiya. If she disturbs a sikkhamānā or a sāmaṇerī, she breaks a minor vinaya rule. Even if it’s a lay person, she transgresses against vinaya and should mentally repent. This is what the World-honored One said.
