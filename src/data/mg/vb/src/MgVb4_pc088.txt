<h2>Origin Story</h2>


<lzh>佛住舍衛城。爾時偷蘭難陀共諸比丘尼鬪諍已。瞋恚自打自抓大啼哭淚出。
諸比丘尼聞已語大愛道。大愛道即以是事往白世尊。佛言。喚是比丘尼來。來已問言。汝實爾不。答言實爾。佛言。汝云何瞋恚自打而啼哭淚出。此非法非律不如佛教。不可以是長養善法。佛告大愛道瞿曇彌。依止舍衛城住比丘尼皆悉令集。乃至已聞者當重聞。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī. At that time, Thullanandā had quarreled with the other bhikkhunīs. Resentful, she hit herself and scratched herself, wept loudly and cried.
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, they told Mahāpajāpatī, and she went to the World-honored One, and informed him of this matter. The Buddha said: “Summon that bhikkhunī.” When she came, he asked her: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this.” The Buddha said: “Why did you resentfully hit yourself, and then weep and cry?

<h2>Explanation</h2>


<lzh>比丘尼者如上說。自打者若手搏若拳敲若杖若土塊若鞭。如是比丘尼自打而啼者波夜提。波夜提者如上說。若比丘尼自打不啼者越比尼罪。啼而不打者亦越比尼罪。自打而啼者波夜提。不打不啼者無罪。若比丘自打而啼越比尼罪。是故世尊說。</lzh>

“A bhikkhunī” is as explained above. “Hitting herself” means striking with the hand, beating with the fist, with a stick, with a clod of earth, or with a whip. If a bhikkhunī hits herself like this and then weeps, it’s a pācittiya. “Pācittiya” is as explained above. If a bhikkhunī hits herself but doesn’t weep, she breaks a minor vinaya rule. If she weeps but doesn’t hit, she also breaks a minor vinaya rule. If she hits herself and weeps, it’s a pācittiya. If she doesn’t hit and doesn’t weep, there’s no offense. If a bhikkhu hits himself and then weeps, he breaks a minor vinaya rule. This is what the World-honored One said.
