<h2>Origin Story</h2>


<lzh>佛住舍衛城。爾時眾多女人在阿耆羅河彼岸。此岸比丘尼僧集。時偷蘭難陀比丘尼。脫衣放地截流浮渡。諸女人共相謂言。看是偷蘭難陀比丘尼浮渡而來。來已於露處坐已。須臾復還渡。諸女人嫌言。云何是偷蘭難陀比丘尼如凶惡人渡已復還。
諸比丘尼聞已語大愛道。大愛道即以是事往白世尊。佛言。喚偷蘭難陀比丘尼來。來已佛言。此是惡事。汝云何於船渡處而獨浮渡。從今日後不聽於船渡處而獨浮渡。佛告大愛道。依止舍衛城。比丘尼皆悉令集。乃至已聞者當重聞。</lzh>

If a bhikkhunī crosses a river alone at a ferry crossing place, it’s an immediate saṅghādisesa offense.”

<lzh>比丘尼者如上說。獨渡者出界到彼岸僧伽婆尸沙。</lzh>

“A bhikkhunī” is as explained above. “Crossing alone” means leaving the territory and going to the far bank. This is a saṅghādisesa.
