<h2>Summary Verse</h2>


<lzh>長鉢減五綴 七日瞋奪衣
賣金并乞縷 緻織及急施
抄市迴僧物 第三跋渠竟</lzh>

<verse>A spare bowl, less than five repairs, seven days, angrily taking back a robe,
Sales with gold, asking for thread, weaving finely, urgent offering,
Snatching and buying, diverting items for the sangha, the third chapter is finished.</verse>

Receiving a robe from a bhikkhunī, having her wash or dye, pure black, a third part of white, silk, six years, a sitting mat, three yojanas, carding sheep wool, a rains bathing robe, a place in the wilderness; these eleven matters (from the bhikkhu rules) should be removed and not recited. The other eleven matters (i.e. those described here in the bhikkhunī rules) should be inserted in the remainder of the last two chapters, after the first chapter. “Receiving a bhikkhunī’s robe” should be removed from the first chapter, and should be replaced with “taking gold and silver”. “Washing an old robe” should be replaced with “trading”. From the last chapter, “a rains bathing robe” should be removed and replaced with “sales with gold”. “A place in the wilderness” should be replaced with “snatching and buying,” so that the number of nissaggiya pācittiyas in the first and second chapters won’t be too low. The 30 matters for bhikkhunīs spoken by the World-honored One are finished.
