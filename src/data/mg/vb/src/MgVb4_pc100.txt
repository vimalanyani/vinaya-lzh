<h2>Origin Story</h2>


<lzh>佛住舍衛城。爾時釋種女拘梨女摩羅女梨車女先已嫁出家。曾任苦事故而有黠慧。大愛道瞿曇彌問佛世尊。已嫁女減二十雨得與受具足不。佛言得。爾時比丘尼與曾嫁八歲九歲女受具足。太小軟弱不堪苦事。諸比丘尼語大愛道。大愛道即以是事往白世尊。乃至已聞者當重聞。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying in Sāvatthī. At that time, women from the clans of the Sakyans, the Kolīyas, the Mallas, and the Licchavis who were married went forth. Because they could already tolerate difficult situations, they were smart and wise. Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī asked the Buddha: “World-honored One, may women who were married, and are below 20 years old receive the full ordination?” The Buddha said: “They may.” Then the bhikkhunīs gave the full ordination to previously married women who were eight or nine years old.

<lzh>減十二雨者如減二十雨中廣說。適他婦者壞梵行。與受具足者波夜提。波夜提者如上說。若適他婦欲於如來法律中受具足者。應先問乃至看手足骨節。是故世尊說。</lzh>

“Less than 12 years old” is as explained in detail in the rule about “less than 20 years”. 


“A married woman” means she has broken celibacy. If she receives the full ordination, it’s a pācittiya. “Pācittiya” is as explained above. If a married woman wants to receive the full ordination in the Tathāgata’s dhamma-vinaya, one should first ask her, … and look at the bones and joints of her hands and feet. This is what the World-honored One said.
