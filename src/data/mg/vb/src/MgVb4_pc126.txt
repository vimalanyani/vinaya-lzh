<h2>Origin Story</h2>


<lzh>佛住毘舍離。爾時有跋陀羅比丘尼。到親里家觀看洗浴。諸婦人言。我與阿梨耶揩身體使我得功德。此比丘尼端正。諸女人欲看其身體故。便聽使揩。即用種種香油塗身。諸比丘尼嫌言。出家人猶故多欲。
諸比丘尼語大愛道。乃至答言。實爾世尊。佛言。汝云何使俗人家婦女揩摩身體。從今日已後不聽。乃至已聞者當重聞。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying in Vesāli. At that time, Bhaddā bhikkhunī had gone to her relatives’ house. Seeing her bathing, the women said: “We’ll rub the venerable’s body and acquire some merit.” The bhikkhunī was graceful, and because the women wanted to see her body, she allowed them to rub it. Then they used all kinds of perfumes and oils, and applied them on her body. The bhikkhunīs were upset and said: “This renunciate still has many wishes.”
The bhikkhunīs told Mahāpajāpatī, … She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha said: “Why did you let lay women massage your body? From now on, it’s no longer allowed.” … Those who have already heard it should listen again:




<h2>Final Ruling</h2>


<lzh>若比丘尼使俗人婦女塗香油揩摩洗浴。除病時波夜提。</lzh>

If a bhikkhunī has a lay woman apply perfume and oil, and massage and wash her, unless she’s sick, it’s a pācittiya.”




<h2>Explanation</h2>


<lzh>比丘尼者如上說。俗人婦女者四種家女。揩摩洗浴者以種種香油揩摩洗浴。若老病者無罪。若不病揩摩洗浴波夜提。波夜提者如上說。若身體有瘡疥。得持藥揩摩洗浴。若熱病得摩耶披屑塗。若風病得以小麥屑塗。若雜病者以雜藥塗無罪。塗已不得在眾人中住。當在邊房。病差洗已當入。若比丘不病。使俗人揩摩越毘尼罪。是故世尊說。</lzh>

“A bhikkhunī” is as explained above. “A lay woman” means a woman from the four classes. “Massaging and washing” means massaging and washing with all kinds of perfumes and oils. If she’s old and sick, there’s no offense. If she’s not sick, and gets massaged and washed, it’s a pācittiya. “Pācittiya” is as explained above. If there’s a wound or scabs on the body, she may massage and wash it with medicine. If she has a fever, she may rub herself and apply barley crumbs. If she has a wind disease, she may apply wheat crumbs. If she has various diseases, and applies various medicines, there’s no offense. After applying it, she may not stay with the group. She must stay in a separate room. When the disease has healed, and she has washed herself, she may return. If a bhikkhu who isn’t sick has lay people massage him, he breaks a minor vinaya rule. This is what the World-honored One said.
