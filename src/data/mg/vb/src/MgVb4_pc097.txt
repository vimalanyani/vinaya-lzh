<h2>Origin Story</h2>


<lzh>佛住舍衛城。爾時世尊制戒。不聽減二十雨童女受具足。時諸比丘尼。滿二十雨童女與受具足。諸比丘尼嫌言。汝滿二十雨不滿二十雨。誰得知者。
諸比丘尼語大愛道。大愛道即以是事往白世尊。乃至佛言。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying in Sāvatthī. At that time, the World-honored One had laid down the precept that it’s not allowed to give the full ordination to a girl of less than 20 rains. Then bhikkhunīs gave the full ordination to girls of 20 rains. The bhikkhunīs were upset and said: “Whether you’ve 20 rains or not, who can know that?”
The bhikkhunīs told Mahāpajāpatī, and she went to the World-honored One, and informed him of this matter. … The Buddha said:




<h2>Preliminary Ruling</h2>


<lzh>從今日已後。十八童女欲於如來法中受具足者。應從僧乞二年學戒。先作求聽羯磨已。然後得乞。</lzh>

From this day on, an 18 year old girl who wants to receive the full ordination in the Tathāgata’s dhamma, should ask the sangha for the training precepts for two years. First a formal act to request permission should be carried out, and afterwards, she should ask.




<h2>Saṅghakamma</h2>


<lzh>羯磨人應作是說。阿梨耶僧聽。某甲十八歲童女。欲於如來法律中受具足。若僧時到。僧某甲欲從僧乞二年學戒。阿梨耶僧聽。某甲十八歲童女。欲從僧乞二年學戒。僧忍默然故。是事如是持。
此女人應從僧乞。作是言。阿梨耶僧聽。我某甲十八歲童女。欲於如來法律中受具足。今從僧乞二年學戒。唯願僧哀愍故與我二年學戒。如是至三。
羯磨人應作是說。阿梨耶僧聽。某甲十八歲童女。欲於如來法律中受具足。已從僧乞二年學戒。若僧時到。僧與某甲二年學戒羯磨。白如是。阿梨耶僧聽。某甲十八歲童女。欲於如來法律中受具足。已從僧乞二年學戒。僧今與某甲二年學戒。阿梨耶僧忍僧與某甲二年學戒。忍者僧默然。若不忍者便說。是第一羯磨。第二第三亦如是說。僧已與某甲二年學戒竟。僧忍默然故。是事如是持。</lzh>

The master of ceremony should say: “Venerables, may the sangha listen. The 18 year old girl So-and-so wants to receive the full ordination in the Tathāgata’s dhamma-vinaya. If the right time has come for the sangha, So-and-so wants to ask the sangha for the training precepts for two years. Venerables, may the sangha listen. The 18 year old girl So-and-so wants to ask the sangha for the training precepts for two years. The sangha accepts this, therefore you’re silent. This matter is remembered thus.” 
That woman should then ask the sangha: “Venerables, may the sangha listen. I, So-and-so, an 18 year old girl, want to receive the full ordination in the Tathāgata’s dhamma-vinaya. Now I ask the sangha for the training precepts for two years. May the sangha give me the training precepts for two years out of compassion.” Like this three requests. 
The master of ceremony should then say: “Venerables, may the sangha listen. The 18 year old girl So-and-so wants to receive the full ordination in the Tathāgata’s dhamma-vinaya. She has asked the sangha for the training precepts for two years. If the right time has come for the sangha, may the sangha give So-and-so the formal act of the two-year-training-precepts. This is the motion. Venerables, may the sangha listen. The 18 year old girl So-and-so wants to receive the full ordination in the Tathāgata’s dhamma-vinaya. She has asked the sangha for the training precepts for two years. The sangha now gives So-and-so the training precepts for two years. Venerables, the sangha accepts that the sangha gives So-and-so the training precepts for two years. If you accept this, the sangha should remain silent. If you don’t accept this, you should speak. This is the first announcement.” A second and third time are recited in the same way. “The sangha has given So-and-so the training precepts for two years. The sangha accepts this, therefore you’re silent. This matter is remembered thus.”

<lzh>佛告大愛道瞿曇彌。依止舍衛城比丘尼皆悉令集。乃至已聞者當重聞。</lzh>

The Buddha told Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī: “Convene all the bhikkhunīs living in the vicinity of Sāvatthī. … Those who have already heard it should listen again:




<h2>Final Ruling</h2>


<lzh>若比丘尼。滿二十歲童女不與學戒。而與具足者波夜提。</lzh>

If a bhikkhunī gives the full ordination to a 20 year old girl who hasn’t been given the training precepts, it’s a pācittiya.”




<h2>Explanation</h2>


<lzh>滿二十歲者滿二十雨。滿二十雨減二十年。亦名滿二十雨。乃至後安居時生。後安居受自恣。數滿二十。是名滿。不與學戒者不與羯磨與學戒。是名不與。十法不具足亦名不與學戒。雖羯磨眾不成就。白不成就。羯磨不成就。若一一不成就。而與受具足者波夜提。是故世尊說。</lzh>

“Twenty years old” means 20 full rains. If she has 20 rains, but has less than 20 calendar years, it’s still called “20 full rains”. … born during the second rains, and been through the invitation ceremonies at the end of the second rains 20 times, this is called “full”. “Not been given the training precepts” means she hasn’t been given the formal act to give training precepts. This is called “not been given”. “Not fulfilling the 10 requirements” is also called “not been given the training precepts”. <note>This seems to refer to the preceptor, not to the girl.</note> Even if a formal act is carried out, if the assembly isn’t complete, or the motion isn’t complete, or the announcements aren’t complete; if any of these aren’t complete, and someone gives the full ordination, it’s a pācittiya. This is what the World-honored One said.
