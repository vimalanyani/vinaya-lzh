The Buddha was staying in Sāvatthī. In Rājagaha, there was a householder called Sudinna. He had a wife who was young and graceful. Her husband passed away, and the wife didn’t want another man. Her brother-in-law wanted to marry her. Then she said to another woman: “I don’t want to have a man, but my brother-in-law wants to take me as his wife.” The woman asked her: “Do you want to get away from him?” She answered: “I want to get away.” Then (that woman) said: “Go to Sāvatthī, and then to Kālī bhikkhunī. She’ll give you the going forth.” So the woman went out on some pretext, and left. She reached Sāvatthī, and asked people: “Where is the bhikkhunī monastery?” Then they showed her the place. She entered and asked: “Where is Kālī bhikkhunī’s room?” Then they showed her the room, she entered, and asked: “Venerable, are you Kālī?” She answered: “Yes. Why do you ask?” She answered: “I want to go forth.” Then she was given the going forth and the full ordination. Her brother-in-law later looked for her but didn’t know where she was. People told him: “Kālī bhikkhunī of Sāvatthī has already given her the going forth.” So he went to Sāvatthī, and asked people: “Where is the bhikkhunī monastery?” Then they showed him the place. He entered and asked: “Where is Kālī bhikkhunī’s room?” Then they showed him the room, he entered, and asked: “Venerable, are you Kālī?” She answered: “Yes. Why do you ask?” He said: “I haven’t released my wife. Why did you give my wife the going forth?” The bhikkhunī answered: “Long-lived One, from where have you come?” He answered: “I came from Rājagaha.” The bhikkhunī scolded him: “Short-lived thing, you’re a criminal. People from Rājagaha always come here because they like to spy, and to investigate the country’s strengths and weaknesses.” Then she said to her student: “Bring my saṅghāṭī. We’ll tie up this short-lived one, and throw him into prison.” The man then became fearful, and thought: “This person has frightening eyes. She might really do this.” Keeping his eyes fixed on her, he slowly retreated. When he was outside, he said resentfully: “This bhikkhunī has stolen my wife and ordained her. And moreover, she wants to tie me up.”
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, they told Mahāpajāpatī, and she went and informed the World-honored One of this matter. The Buddha said: “Summon that bhikkhunī.” When she came, he asked her: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this.” The Buddha said: “Kālī, this is an unwholesome thing. Why did you ordain someone whose guardian hadn’t allowed it? From now on, it’s no longer allowed to ordain someone who hasn’t been released by her guardian.” Then he said to Mahāpajāpatī: “Convene all the bhikkhunīs living in the vicinity of Sāvatthī. … Those who have already heard it should listen again:




<h2>Final Ruling</h2>


<lzh>若比丘尼其主不聽而度。是法初罪僧伽婆尸沙。</lzh>

If a bhikkhunī ordains someone whose guardian hasn’t allowed it, it’s an immediate saṅghādisesa offense.”




<h2>Explanation</h2>


<lzh>比丘尼者如上說。不聽者。未嫁女。當問父母。已出嫁當問婿姑妐及叔。不聽者度出家受具足者。僧伽婆尸沙。僧伽婆尸沙者如上說。是法初罪。若比丘尼主不聽而度者越比尼罪。與學戒者偷蘭遮。受具足者僧伽婆尸沙。是故世尊說。</lzh>

“A bhikkhunī” is as explained above. “Not allowed” means if she’s not yet married, she should ask her parents. If she has already left and is married, she should ask her husband, her parents-in-law, or her brothers-in-law. If (a bhikkhunī) gives the going forth and the full ordination to someone who hasn’t been allowed, it’s a saṅghādisesa. “A saṅghādisesa” is as explained above. This is an immediate offense. If a bhikkhunī gives the going forth to someone whose guardian hasn’t allowed it, she breaks a minor vinaya rule. If she gives her the (sikkhamānā) training precepts, it’s a thullaccaya. If she gives her the full ordination, it’s a saṅghādisesa. This is what the World-honored One said.
