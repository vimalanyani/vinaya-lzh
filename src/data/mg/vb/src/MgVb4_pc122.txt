<h2>Origin Story</h2>


<lzh>佛住毘舍離。爾時跋陀羅比丘尼到親里家。與兄弟姊妹兒。申手內住共耳語。奴婢嫌言。此出家人耳語。正當說我等過。
諸比丘尼聞已。語大愛道瞿曇彌乃至已聞者當重聞。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying at Vesāli. At that time, Bhaddā bhikkhunī went to her relatives’ house, and wispered in the ears of her brothers’ and sisters’ sons, while staying within arm’s reach. The slaves were upset and said: “This renunciate whispers in their ears. Surely she speaks about our faults.”
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, they told Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī, … Those who have already heard it should listen again:




<h2>Final Ruling</h2>


<lzh>若比丘尼與男子申手內住若耳語波夜提。</lzh>

If a bhikkhunī stays within arm’s reach of a man, and whispers in his ear, it’s a pācittiya.”




<h2>Explanation</h2>


<lzh>比丘尼者如上說。申手內者共申手內住。耳語者耳邊共語波夜提。比丘尼不得與男子申手內住共語若耳語。若欲共語者。當在申手外。若欲論密事。當隔籬隔壁隔樹隔縵。比丘尼波夜提。比丘與女人申手內住共耳語越毘尼罪。是故世尊說。</lzh>

“A bhikkhunī” is as explained above. “Within arm’s reach” means staying together within arm’s reach. “Whispering in the ear” means talking with each other next to the ear; this is a pācittiya. A bhikkhunī may not stay within arm’s reach of a man, and talk with him, if she whispers in his ear. If they want to talk with each other, they should stay out of arm’s reach. If they want to discuss secrets, they should be separated by a fence, a wall, a tree, or a screen. For a bhikkhunī, this is a pācittiya. For a bhikkhu, if he stays within arm’s reach of a woman and they whisper in each other’s ears, he breaks a minor vinaya rule. This is what the World-honored One said.
