<h2>Origin Story</h2>


<lzh>佛住毘舍離。廣說如上。爾時離車初生二男。次生一女以為不吉。心自念言。今此不祥之女誰當取者。有人語言。汝欲安處此女不。答言欲得。若爾者可持。與迦梨比丘尼。當與汝養育。即便喚迦梨來。白言阿梨耶。我今生此不吉之女無人取者。與我長養度令出家。我自給衣食。比丘尼即取養育便與出家。家中日日送食年年與衣。長大與學戒。次受具足女人之法婬欲偏多。年遂轉大欲情亦熾。不能自制。即白師言。我結使起不樂出家。今欲還俗。師言怪哉。俗中猶如火坑。何由可樂。從是以後。漸與俗人及諸外道交通遂便有娠。比丘尼即便驅出。語其師言。汝不知弟子與俗人外道私通耶。答言。我亦早知。但其家日日送食年年得衣。若當白僧便當驅出。我利此二事是故不說</lzh>

The Buddha was staying in Vesālī. As explained in detail above. At that time, two boys were born first into a Licchavi family, and then a girl was born inauspiciously. They thought: “Now who will take care of this misfortunate girl?” People asked them: “Do you want to place that girl (somewhere else)?” They answered: “We want to do that.” “In that case, you can take her to Kālī bhikkhunī who will raise her for you.” They summoned Kālī and said: “Venerable, this inauspicious girl has now been born into our family, and nobody takes care of her. Raise her for us and give her the going forth. We’ll provide robes and food.” The bhikkhunī then took her, raised her, and gave her the going forth. Her family sent food every day and gave robes every year. When she had grown up, she was given the training precepts and then received the full ordination. In a woman’s nature, sexual desire abounds. As she was getting older, she burned with passions and couldn’t restrain herself. Then she informed her teacher: “My defilements have arisen and I’m not happy as a renunciate. I now want to return to lay life.” The teacher said: “How strange! The lay world is like a fiery pit. How could you be happy there?” After that, she slowly associated with lay people and non-Buddhist renunciates, and soon became pregnant. The bhikkhunīs then expelled her, and said to her teacher: “Didn’t you know that your student had affairs with lay people and non-Buddhist renunciates?” She answered: “I knew it very early. But her family sends food every day, and offers robes every year. If I had told the sangha, you’d have expelled her. I benefit from these two things, therefore I didn’t tell you.”


<lzh>。比丘尼即語大愛道。大愛道即以是事往白世尊佛言。喚迦梨來。來已問言。汝實爾不。答言。實爾世尊。佛言。此是惡事。迦梨汝云何知比丘尼犯重罪。覆藏此非法非律不可以是長養善法。佛語大愛道。依止毘舍離比丘尼皆悉令集。乃至已聞者當重聞。</lzh>

The bhikkhunīs then told Mahāpajāpatī, and she went and informed the World-honored One of this matter. The Buddha said: “Summon Kālī.” When she came, he asked her: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha said: “This is an unwholesome thing. Kālī, why did you, knowing that a bhikkhunī had committed a grave offense, conceal it? This is against the dhamma, against the vinaya. One can’t develop in wholesome states like this.” The Buddha told Mahāpajāpatī: “Convene all the bhikkhunīs living in the vicinity of Vesālī. … Those who have already heard it should listen again:




<h2>Final Ruling</h2>


<lzh>若比丘尼知比丘尼犯重罪不向人說。是比丘尼若離處若死若罷道。後作是言。我先知是比丘尼犯重罪。不向人說。不欲令他知。是比丘尼波羅夷不應共住。</lzh>

If a bhikkhunī knows that another bhikkhunī has committed a grave offense, and doesn’t tell anyone, and if that second bhikkhunī leaves that place, or dies, or disrobes, she afterwards says: “I knew before that that bhikkhunī committed a grave offense, and didn’t tell anyone. I didn’t want to let others know,” that bhikkhunī is pārājika, and shouldn’t live in community.”




<h2>Explanation</h2>


<lzh>比丘尼者如上說。知者。若自知若從他聞。重罪者。八波羅夷中若犯一一。不向人說者。不向一人若眾多若僧中不說。離處者若驅出。死者無常。罷道者離此法律作俗人外道。已後便言。我先知其犯罪但不欲令人知。是比丘尼波羅夷不應共住。波羅夷者如上說。</lzh>

“A bhikkhunī” is as explained above. “Knows” means she either knows herself or hears it from others. “A grave offense” means committing any of the eight pārājikas. “Not telling anyone” means not telling an individual, a group, or the sangha. “Leaving that place” means she’s expelled. “Dying” means succumbing to impermanence. “Disrobing” means leaving this dhamma and vinaya, and becoming a lay person or a non-Buddhist renunciate. If she says afterwards: “I knew before that she committed an offense, but I didn’t want to let others know,” that bhikkhunī is pārājika, and shouldn’t live in community. “A pārājika” is as explained above. 


<lzh>若比丘尼明相出時。見比丘尼犯重罪。不作覆藏心。至日出時作覆藏心至明相出時。是比丘尼犯波羅夷。是名二時。如是乃至八時。如比丘覆藏中廣說。若比丘尼見比丘尼犯重罪。應向人說。若見共住弟子依止弟子犯重罪。便作是念。我若向人說者。比丘尼便當驅出。以愛念故覆藏其罪。得波羅夷。是比丘尼聞是語已。語知識比丘尼言。某甲犯重罪。若我語人者比丘尼僧當驅出。是以我覆藏。彼比丘尼聞已復作是念。我若說者是二人俱驅出即便覆藏。俱得波羅夷。</lzh>

If a bhikkhunī goes out at dawn, sees another bhikkhunī commit a grave offense, and doesn’t have the intention to conceal it, but at sunrise has the intention to conceal it, then at the next dawn, that bhikkhunī has committed a pārājika. This is called “the two times.” In the same way … the eight times.<note>dawn, sunrise, mealtime, noon, afternoon, sunset, evening, midnight.</note> As explained in detail in the bhikkhu rule about concealing. If a bhikkhunī sees another bhikkhunī commit a grave offense, she should tell others. If she sees a student living with her or depending on her commit a grave offense, and thinks: “If I tell others, the bhikkhunīs will expel her,” and conceals her offense out of affection, she incurs a pārājika. If a bhikkhunī who has heard (of an offense), says to a bhikkhunī who is a friend: “So-and-so has committed a grave offense. If I tell others, the bhikkhunī sangha will expel her. Therefore, I’ll conceal it,” and that bhikkhunī, when she has heard it, also thinks: “If I tell someone, these two people will both be expelled,” and then also conceals it, they all incur pārājikas.


<lzh>如是一切展轉覆藏。皆波羅夷。若比丘尼見他犯重罪。語餘比丘尼言。我見某甲犯重罪。此比丘尼即呵言。汝今作惡何故語我莫復說。得偷蘭遮。若比丘尼見比丘尼。犯重罪。應向人說。若犯罪人兇惡可畏有勢力恐奪其命傷梵行者。當作是念。行業罪報彼自應知。喻如失火燒屋。但當自救焉知他事。得捨心相應者無罪。是故說。</lzh>

In this way, all who conceal each other in a row are pārājika. If a bhikkhunī sees another commit a grave offense, and says to another bhikkhunī: “I saw So-and-so commit a grave offense,” and that bhikkhunī then criticizes her: “You just did something unwholesome. Why did you tell me? Don’t speak about it again,” (the second bhikkhunī) incurs a thullaccaya. If a bhikkhunī sees another bhikkhunī commit a grave offense, she should tell others. If the offender is fierce, frightening, and stronger, and she fears that she’ll take her life or harm her monastic life, she should think: “She should know herself about the kammic retributions, just as an out-of-control fire burns down a house. One can only save oneself. Why should I get involved in other people’s affairs,” and she’s able to thoroughly let it go in her mind, there’s no offense. This is what was said.
