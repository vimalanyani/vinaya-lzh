<h2>Origin Story</h2>


<lzh>佛住毘舍離。爾時迦梨比丘尼度梨車第三生女出家。與俗人外道習近住。諸比丘尼語迦梨比丘尼。汝知是弟子與俗人外道習近住。汝何故不別離送於異方。
諸比丘尼語大愛道。大愛道即以是事往白世尊。佛言。呼是比丘尼來。來已問言。汝實爾不。答言實爾。佛言。此是惡事。汝云何知弟子共俗人外道習近住而不離別。從今已後不聽。佛告大愛道。依止毘舍離住比丘尼皆悉令集。乃至已聞者當重聞。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying in Vesāli. At that time, Kālī bhikkhunī gave the going forth to a Licchavi woman, who was born as the third child, and who then lived closely together with lay people and non-Buddhist renunciates. The bhikkhunīs said to Kālī bhikkhunī: “You know that this student lives closely together with lay people and non-Buddhist renunciates. Why don’t you separate her, and send her to another place?”
The bhikkhunīs told Mahāpajāpatī, and she went to the World-honored One, and informed him of this matter. The Buddha said: “Summon that bhikkhunī.” When she came, he asked her: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this.” The Buddha said: “This is an unwholesome thing. Why did you, when you knew that your student was living closely together with lay people and non-Buddhist renunciates, not separate her? From now on, it’s no longer allowed.” The Buddha told Mahāpajāpatī: “Convene all the bhikkhunīs living in the vicinity of Vesāli. … Those who have already heard it should listen again:




<h2>Final Ruling</h2>


<lzh>若比丘尼度弟子有事。不自送不使人送。下至五六由旬波夜提。</lzh>

If a bhikkhunī, when there’s an issue with the student to whom she has given the going forth, doesn’t send her away herself, nor has others send her away, less than five or six yojanas, it’s a pācittiya.”




<h2>Explanation</h2>


<lzh>比丘尼者如上說。度人者和上尼。弟子者共行弟子。有事者弟子欲罷道。若父母親里欲罷道。若婿若叔欲罷道。送者若不自送不使人送。下至五六由旬者極齊六。若弟子習近住者應送遊行。若身老病不能去者應囑人。當教誡汝可遊方多有功德。禮諸塔寺見好徒眾多所見聞我若不老者亦復欲去。若比丘共住弟子有事。不自送不使人送者得越毘尼罪。是故世尊說。</lzh>

“A bhikkhunī” is as explained above. “The person who gives the going forth” means the preceptor. “A student” means a student who practises with her. “There’s an issue” means that the student wants to disrobe, or her parents, her relatives, her husband, or her brothers-in-law want her to disrobe. “Sending her away” means not sending her away oneself, or having others send her away. “Less than five or six yojanas” means a maximum of six. If a student lives closely together with others, one should send her wandering. If one is old or sick, and one can’t leave, one should ask others (to take her away), and teach and instruct her: “In being able to wander to other places, there’s a lot of merit. Pay respect at stupas or temples, meet well-practising sanghas, and see and hear a lot. If I wasn’t old, I’d also like to go.” If there’s an issue with a bhikkhu’s student who lives with him, and he doesn’t send him away, nor has others send him away, he breaks a minor vinaya rule. This is what the World-honored One said.
