<h2>Origin Story</h2>


<lzh>佛住拘睒彌。爾時世尊制戒不得作醫師活命。有人呼闡陀母治病。比丘尼言。世尊制戒不聽。復言。若不聽者授我醫方。即授與俗人外道醫方。諸比丘尼言。但誦醫方此非出家法。
諸比丘尼語大愛道。大愛道即以是事具白世尊。佛言。呼比丘尼來。來已問言。汝實爾不。答言實爾。佛言。從今日後。不聽授俗人外道醫方。佛告大愛道瞿曇彌。依止拘睒彌比丘尼皆悉令集。乃至已聞者當重聞。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying in Kosambī. At that time, the World-honored One had laid down a precept that it’s not allowed to earn a living as a doctor.

The bhikkhunīs said: “She just teaches medicinal treatments, she hasn’t gone forth in the dhamma.”

<h2>Final Ruling</h2>

<h2>Explanation</h2>


<lzh>比丘尼者如上說。俗人者在家人。外道者出家外道。授醫方者呪蛇呪毒乃至呪火呪星宿日月波夜提波夜提者如上說。比丘尼不得授俗人外道醫方。不得教語。若比丘授俗人外道醫方者越比尼罪。是故世尊說。</lzh>

“A bhikkhunī” is as explained above. “Lay people” means householders. “Non-Buddhist renunciates” means those gone forth in another religion. “Teaching medicinal treatments” means magical remedies based on snakes, poisons, … fire, and stellar, lunar, and solar constellations. This is a pācittiya. “Pācittiya” is as explained above. A bhikkhunī may not teach lay people and non-Buddhist renunciates medicinal treatments. She may not instruct. If a bhikkhu teaches lay people and non-Buddhist renunciates medicinal treatments, he breaks a minor vinaya rule. This is what the World-honored One said.
