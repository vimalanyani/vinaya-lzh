<h2>Origin Story</h2>


<lzh>佛住舍衛城。爾時比丘尼。舍衛城安居竟。來詣比舍離。往到跋陀羅比丘尼親里家。其家人問何處安居。答言。舍衛城。問。舍衛城何似好不。比丘尼言。祇洹樹林華果茂盛池水清涼。精舍如是。世尊住處如是。尊者舍利弗大目連如是。須達居士如是。檀越言。此是真出家。今我跋陀羅此處生此處長。如無手足人。初不肯出。
諸比丘尼以是因緣往白世尊。乃至答言。實爾。佛言。汝云何安居竟而不遊行。從今已後不聽。乃至已聞者當重聞。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying in Sāvatthī. At that time, a bhikkhunī, when the rains retreat in Sāvatthī had ended, came to Vesālī, and went to the house of Bhaddā bhikkhunī’s relatives. Her family members asked: “Where did you spend the rains?” She answered: “At Sāvatthī.” They asked: “What is good and bad about Sāvatthī?” The bhikkhunī said: “Jeta’s grove has abundant flowers and fruits, and the water in the ponds is pure and cool. The monastery is such-and-such, and the World-honored One’s residence is such-and-such. The venerables Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna are such-and-such, and the householder Sudatta is such-and-such.” The supporters said: “This is true going forth. Now our Bhaddā was born here, and gets old here. Like a person without hand and feet. From the outset, she refused to go out.”
For this reason, the bhikkhunīs went and informed the World-honored One. … She answered: “I really did this.” The Buddha said: “Why did you not wander after the end of the rains retreat? From now on, it’s no longer allowed.” … Those who have already heard it should listen again:




<h2>Final Ruling</h2>


<lzh>若比丘尼。安居竟不遊行者波夜提。</lzh>

<h2>Explanation</h2>


<lzh>安居竟者。三月竟。不遊行者。乃至不出聚落行波夜提。波夜提者如上說。安居竟乃至不離界一宿行波夜提。若羸老病不能行無罪。是故世尊說。</lzh>

“The end of the rains retreat” means when the three months are over. “Not wandering” means not even leaving the village; this is a pācittiya. “Pācittiya” is as explained above. When the rains retreat has ended, if she doesn’t even leave the territory for one night, it’s a pācittiya. If she’s weak, old, or sick and can’t go, there’s no offense. This is what the World-honored One said.
