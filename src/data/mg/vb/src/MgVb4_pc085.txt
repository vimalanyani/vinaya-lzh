<h2>Origin Story</h2>


<lzh>佛住舍衛城。爾時有夫婦二人。日中時自於屋內無人想處。欲行婬事。爾時偷蘭難陀比丘尼先不語。卒爾便入。其夫見之忿恚。妨我行欲。身生猶起不息。即逐欲捉比丘尼。比丘尼畏之急走來還住處。語諸比丘尼言。今日殆壞我梵行。
諸比丘尼語大愛道。大愛道即以是事往白世尊。佛言。喚是比丘尼來。來已佛問言。汝實爾不。答言實爾。佛言。此是惡事。汝云何知食家不先語而入。從今已後不聽。佛告大愛道瞿曇彌。依止舍衛城比丘尼皆悉令集乃至已聞者當重聞。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī. At that time, there was a couple, husband and wife. In the middle of the day, they were inside a room, thinking that nobody was there, and wanting to have sex. Then Thullanandā bhikkhunī, without calling out first, suddenly entered. When the husband saw her, he got angry: “You prevented me from following my desires.” He had an errection. He then chased the bhikkhunī, trying to get hold of her. She rushed out in fear, and returned to her dwelling place. She told the other bhikkhunīs: “Today, I almost broke my celibacy.”
The bhikkhunīs told Mahāpajāpatī, and she went to the World-honored One, and informed him of this matter. The Buddha said: “Summon that bhikkhunī.” When she came, he asked her: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this.” The Buddha said: “This is an unwholesome thing. Why did you knowingly enter a house where people are “eating” (having sex) without calling out first? From now on, it’s no longer allowed.” The Buddha told Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī: “Convene all the bhikkhunīs living in the vicinity of Sāvatthī. … Those who have already heard it should listen again:




<h2>Final Ruling</h2>


<lzh>若比丘尼知食家先不語而入者波夜提。</lzh>

<h2>Explanation</h2>


<lzh>比丘尼者如上說。知者若自知若從他聞。食者女人是丈夫食。丈夫是女人食。家者剎利家。婆羅門家。毘舍家。首陀羅家。如是比先不語者先不語而入波夜提。波夜提者如上說。若比丘尼先不語不得入。若欲入者應語守門者。我欲入。若守門者白已言入乃入。若守門者不還不得入。若聞房中語聲。當彈指動脚作聲。若彼默然者不得入。若來出迎得入。若比丘先不語而入者越毘尼罪。是故世尊說。</lzh>

“A bhikkhunī” is as explained above. “Knowingly” means knowing oneself or hearing it from others. “Eating” means a woman is the husband’s food, and a husband is the woman’s food (i.e. they’re having sex). “House” means a noble house, a brahmin house, a merchant house, or a worker house. “Not calling out first” means entering without calling out first is a pācittiya. “Pācittiya” is as explained above. If a bhikkhunī doesn’t call out first, she may not enter. If she wants to enter, she should tell the gate-keeper: “I want to enter.” If having spoken to the gate-keeper, he replies: “You may enter,” she may then enter. If the gate-keeper hasn’t returned, she may not enter. If she hears words and sounds from inside a room, she should snap her fingers, or tap her feet to make noise. If the others become silent, she may not enter. If the come out to greet her, she may enter. If a bhikkhu enters without calling out first, he breaks a minor vinaya rule. This is what the World-honored One said.
