<lzh>二無根如比丘中廣說。是故世尊說。</lzh>

Two rules on “unfounded,” as explained in detail in the bhikkhu rules. This is what the World-honored One said.




<h2>Final Ruling</h2>


<lzh>若比丘尼瞋恨不喜故。於清淨無罪比丘尼。以無根波羅夷法謗。欲破彼比丘尼淨行。彼於後時若撿挍若不撿挍。便作是言。是事無根。我住瞋恨故作是語。是法初罪。</lzh>

If a bhikkhunī, angry and dissatisfied, slanders a pure, innocent bhikkhunī with an unfounded pārājika offense, wanting to destroy that bhikkhunī’s monastic life, and at a later time, whether examined or not examined, says: ‘This matter is unfounded. I said this because I was harboring anger,’ it’s an immediate offense.
