<beginh2>Origin Story<endh2>


<beginchinese>佛住舍衛城。爾時比丘尼多畜弟子不教誡。如天牛天羊。淨不具足。威儀不具足。不知承事和上阿闍梨。不知承事長老比丘尼。不知入聚落法阿練若法。不知著衣持鉢法。
比丘尼語大愛道。大愛道即以是事往白世尊。佛言。呼是比丘尼來。來已佛問。汝實爾不。答言。實爾。世尊。佛言。此是惡事。汝云何度人而不教誡。從今已後。應二年教誡。佛告大愛道瞿曇彌。依止舍衛城住比丘尼皆悉令集。乃至已聞者當重聞。<endchinese>

The Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī. At that time, a bhikkhunī took on many students, but didn’t teach and instruct them. They were like heavenly cows and goats. They didn’t fulfill purity, they didn’t conduct themselves properly, they didn’t know how to behave respectfully towards their preceptor, teachers, and the senior bhikkhunīs. They didn’t know the rules for entering the village and the wilderness. They didn’t know the rules for wearing the robes and holding the bowl.
The bhikkhunīs told Mahāpajāpatī, and she went to the World-honored One, and informed him of this matter. The Buddha said: “Summon that bhikkhunī.” When she came, he asked her: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha said: “This is an unwholesome thing. Why did you give the going forth to people, and not teach and instruct them?<beginnote>The text says 度: “give the going forth,” but the rule is about the full ordination.<endnote> From now on, you should teach and instruct them for two years.” The Buddha told Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī: “Convene all the bhikkhunīs living in the vicinity of Sāvatthī. … Those who have already heard it should listen again:




<beginh2>Final Ruling<endh2>


<beginchinese>若比丘尼與弟子受具足已。應二年教誡。若不教者波夜提。<endchinese>

If a bhikkhunī has given the full ordination to a student, she should teach and instruct her for two years. If she doesn’t teach her, it’s a pācittiya.”




<beginh2>Explanation<endh2>


<beginchinese>比丘尼者如上說。弟子者共住弟子。二年者二雨時。教誡者若阿毘曇。若毘尼。阿毘曇者九部修多羅。毘尼者波羅提木叉廣略。威儀應教。非威儀應遮。若不教誡者波夜提。若弟子不可教不欲學者應驅出。若比丘共住弟子不教勅越毘尼罪。是故世尊說。<endchinese>

“A bhikkhunī” is as explained above. “A student” means a student who lives with her. “Two years” means two rains. “Teach and instruct” means the abhidhamma and the vinaya. “Abhidhamma” means the nine parts of the suttas. “Vinaya” means the pātimokkha in brief and with its detailed explanation. Proper conduct should be taught. Improper conduct should be corrected. If she doesn’t teach and instruct, it’s a pācittiya. If the student can’t be taught, and doesn’t want to train, she should be expelled. If a bhikkhu lives together with a student, and doesn’t teach and exhort him, he breaks a minor vinaya rule. This is what the World-honored One said.
