The Buddha was staying at Vesālī. At that time, there was a merchant from the north who had an expensive, good woolen cloth and went around to sell it. People asked: “How much do you want for it?” He answered: “100,000.” Then the king, the princes, the high officials, and the other great merchants all didn’t like the high price, and didn’t buy it. So he sat in his shop worrying. People asked: “Why do you look so worried?” He answered: “When I bought<beginnote>The original says “sold” but it’s probably a typo. See the parallel phrase in the next rule.<endnote> this woolen cloth, the price and the taxes were high, but now I can’t sell it. That’s why I’m unhappy.” People said: “Do you want to sell it?” He answered: “I want to sell it.” Then they said: “You can take it, and go to the renunciate Bhaddā. She’ll buy it.” Then he took it, went out, and asked people: “Where is the bhikkhunī monastery?” When people had shown him the place, he asked: “Where is Bhaddā bhikkhunī’s room?” When people had shown him the place, he asked: “Who is Bhaddā?” Bhaddā bhikkhunī answered: “Why do you ask?” He answered: “Do you want to buy this woolen cloth?” She asked: “How much do you want for it?” He answered: “100,000.” Then without bargaining, she said to a student: “Go and tell people at my relatives’ shop to take 100.000, and give it to him.” People asked: “Have you sold the woolen cloth yet?” He answered: “I’ve sold it.” They asked: “Who took it?” He answered: “The renunciate Bhaddā.” Those people then were upset, and said: “Renunciates have such indulgent wishes.”
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, they told Mahāpajāpatī, and she then went to the World-honored One and informed him of this matter. The Buddha said: “Summon that bhikkhunī.” When she came, he asked her: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this.” The Buddha told the bhikkhunī: “Don’t you set a standard for later generations? From now on, it’s no longer allowed to buy a heavy robe for more than four kārṣāpaṇas.” The Buddha told Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī: “Convene all the bhikkhunīs living in the vicinity of Vesalī. … Those who have already heard it should listen again:




<beginh2>Final Ruling<endh2>


<beginchinese>若比丘尼過四羯利沙槃市重衣尼薩耆波夜提。<endchinese>

If a bhikkhunī buys a heavy robe for more than four kārṣāpaṇas, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya.”




<beginh2>Explanation<endh2>


<beginchinese>比丘尼者如上說。四羯利沙槃者四四十九故錢。重衣者欽婆羅衣。市者知取也。若過十九故錢取者尼薩耆波夜提。尼薩耆波夜提者如上說。若比丘尼不得過十九故錢市重衣若不乞自與雖貴價無罪。比丘尼有限比丘無限。雖貴價知取受用無罪。是故世尊說。<endchinese>

“A bhikkhunī” is as explained above. “Four kārṣāpaṇas” means four times four, thus 16 old coins<beginnote>There were different coins in use in ancient India, the larger one being worth four times the smaller one. The names of the coins and their values vary between schools. Variant readings also say 19 old coins instead of 16.<endnote>. “A heavy robe” means a woolen robe. “Buys” means knowingly taking it. If she takes something worth more than 16 old coins, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. “A nissaggiya pācittiya” is as explained above. A bhikkhunī may not buy a heavy robe worth more than 16 old coins. If she doesn’t ask and is offered a robe, even if it’s more expensive, there is no offense. For bhikkhunīs, there is this limit. For bhikkhus, there is no limit. Even if he knowingly takes an expensive robe, and uses it, there is no offense. This is what the World-honored One said.
