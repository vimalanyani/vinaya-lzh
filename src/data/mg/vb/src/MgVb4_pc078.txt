<h2>First Origin Story</h2>


<lzh>佛住比舍離。爾時跋陀羅比丘尼家中常與送食。得已更煎更熬更調和。其兄弟伯叔來見已言我欲食。答言可爾。即取而食。覺氣味異常。問言何處得此好食。答言故是家中所送耳。即便恚言。我家從來作食徒棄錢財初不得好食。即還家鞭打奴婢罵言。虛棄錢物而不可食。其使人瞋恚言。坐此比丘尼。得苦惱如是。諸比丘尼聞已語大愛道。大愛道即以是事往白世尊佛言。呼跋陀羅比丘尼來。來已問言。汝實爾不。答言實爾。佛言。此是惡事。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying in Vesālī. At that time, Bhaddā bhikkhunī’s family often sent her food. When she received it, she fried, boiled, and seasoned it again. When her brothers and uncles came to see her, they said: “We’d like some food.” She answered: “Okay.” Then they took and ate it, and noticed that the smell and the flavor were exceptional. They asked: “Where did you get this good food from?” She answered: “It was just my old family who sent it.” Then they said angrily: “The cooks in our home always waste much money, and we still don’t get good food.” They then returned home, whipped and beat the slaves, and scolded them: “You waste money in vain, and we still can’t eat.” These people became resentful, and said: “Because of that bhikkhunī, we incurred suffering and vexation like this.” When the bhikkhunīs heard this, they told Mahāpajāpatī, and she went to the World-honored One, and informed him of this matter. The Buddha said: “Summon Bhaddā bhikkhunī.” When she came, he asked her: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this.” The Buddha said: “This is an unwholesome thing.




<h2>Preliminary Ruling</h2>


<lzh>從今日後。不聽自煮熬煎。</lzh>

From now on, it’s no longer allowed to cook, boil, or fry oneself.




<h2>Second Origin Story</h2>


<lzh>復次佛住舍衛城。爾時有比丘尼。是釋種女摩羅女。行乞食得宿飯宿羹宿菜。食已吐逆。諸比丘尼語大愛道。大愛道往白世尊。得聽我等溫食不。佛言得。佛告大愛道瞿曇彌。依止比舍離比丘尼皆悉令集。乃至已聞者當重聞。</lzh>

Another time, the Buddha was staying in Sāvatthī. Then there were bhikkhunīs from the Sakyan and Mallan clans. When they went on almsround, they received rice, curries, and vegetables leftover from the day before. When they ate it, they vomited. The bhikkhunīs told Mahāpajāpatī, and she went and asked the World-honored One: “May we obtain permission to reheat food?” The Buddha said: “You may.” The Buddha told Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī: “Convene all the bhikkhunīs living in the vicinity of Vesālī.<note>Should read “Sāvatthī.</note>” … Those who have already heard it should listen again:




<h2>Final Ruling</h2>


<lzh>若比丘尼得佉陀尼食蒲闍尼食。更煮使人煮。更熬使人熬。更煎使人煎。不病比丘尼食者波夜提。</lzh>

If a bhikkhunī receives staple or non-staple food, and she still cooks it or has others cook it, boils it or has others boil it, or frys it or has others fry it, and if that bhikkhunī eats it when she’s not sick, it’s a pācittiya.”




<h2>Explanation</h2>


<lzh>佉陀尼者五佉陀尼食。蒲闍尼者五蒲闍尼食。更煮者若自煮使人煮。熬者若自熬若使人熬。煎者若自煎若使人煎。病者世尊說無罪。云何病。老病羸瘦食冷吐逆不樂。不病比丘尼煮食食者波夜提。波夜提者如上說不聽為美食故更熬更煎。若冷得溫。不聽銚釜中煮。若用銅盂。若鉤鉢鍵鎡中溫。若比丘為美故自更煮更熬更煎越比尼罪。若使淨人知者無罪。若乞食時食冷更溫無罪。是故世尊說。</lzh>

“Staple food” means the five kinds of staple foods.<note>Pāli: khādanīya.</note> “Non-staple food” means the five kinds of non-staple foods.<note>Pāli: bhojanīya.</note> “Cooking again” means she either cooks herself or has others cook. “Boiling” means she either boils herself or has others boil. “Frying” means she either fries herself or has others fry. “Sick” means the World-honored One said there’s no offense. What is “sick?” Old age, sickness, being weak and feeble, eating cold food, vomiting, being uncomfortable. If a bhikkhunī who isn’t sick cooks food and eats it, it’s a pācittiya. “Pācittiya” is as explained above. It’s not allowed to boil or fry again to make the food nicer. If it’s cold, it may be reheated. It’s not allowed to cook in a pan or a pot. She should use a copper bowl, an earthen bowl, or a brass vessel to reheat things. <note>It seems that the Buddha didn’t allow the use of lay people’s cooking utensils. Instead, almsbowls made from unallowable materials, such as copper bowls (銅盂 — tāmra-pātra), earthen bowls (鉤鉢 — kupātra) and brass vessels (鍵鎡 — kāṁsika) were to be used. Maybe such bowls accumulated in the monasteries because lay people didn’t know that only clay (瓦鉢) and iron almsbowls (鐵鉢) were allowed, and so the monastics were to make use of them in other ways.</note> If a bhikkhu cooks, boils, or fries food again to make it nicer, he breaks a minor vinaya rule. If he informs attendants, there’s no offense. If the food is cold when he goes on almsround, and he reheats it, there’s no offense. This is what the World-honored One said.
