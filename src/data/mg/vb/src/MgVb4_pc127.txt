Origin Story

佛住毘舍離。爾時世尊制戒。不聽俗人婦女揩摩洗浴。時跋陀羅比丘尼使比丘尼揩摩。
諸比丘尼以是因緣往白世尊。乃至已聞者當重聞。
The Buddha was staying at Vesāli. At that time, the World-honored One had laid down a precept that it’s not allowed to have lay women massage and wash (a bhikkhunī). Then Bhaddā bhikkhunī had another bhikkhunī massage her.

Final Ruling

若比丘尼不病。使比丘尼揩摩洗浴者波夜提。
If a bhikkhunī who isn’t sick has another bhikkhunī massage and wash her, it’s a pācittiya.”


Explanation

若揩而不摩越毘尼罪。摩而不揩亦越毘尼罪。二俱者波夜提。若比丘不病。令比丘揩摩者越毘尼罪。是故世尊說。
If she’s rubbed but not massaged, she breaks a minor vinaya rule. If she’s massaged but not rubbed, she also breaks a minor vinaya rule. If both, it’s a pācittiya. If a bhikkhu who isn’t sick has another bhikkhu massage him, he breaks a minor vinaya rule. This is what the World-honored One said.
