<h2>Origin Story</h2>


<lzh>佛住王舍城。破僧相助如比丘中廣說。是故世尊說。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying in Rājagaha. “Splitting the sangha” and “Helping each other” are as explained in detail in the bhikkhu rules. This is what the World-honored One said.




<h2>Final Ruling</h2>


<lzh>若比丘尼欲破和合僧。故勤方便執持破僧事共諍。諸比丘尼應語是比丘尼。阿梨耶。莫破和合僧。勤方便執持破僧事共諍。當與僧同事。何以故。僧和合歡喜不諍。共一學如水乳合。如法說安樂住。是比丘尼。諸比丘尼諫時。堅持不捨者。應第二第三諫。捨者善。若不捨者是法乃至三諫。僧伽婆尸沙。</lzh>

If a bhikkhunī, because she wants to split the sangha in harmony, strives with expedient means, holds on to matters which split the sangha, and quarrels with others, the bhikkhunīs should say to that bhikkhunī: ‘Venerable, don’t split the sangha in harmony by striving with expedient means, holding on to matters which split the sangha, and quarreling with others. You should conduct matters together with the sangha. Why? A sangha in harmony is happy and doesn’t quarrel. We should train together, mix like water and milk, speak according to dhamma, and live comfortably.’ If that bhikkhunī when admonished by the bhikkhunīs persists firmly, and doesn’t give it up, she should be admonished a second and a third time. If she gives up this matter, it’s fine. If not, this rule is a saṅghādisesa after three admonishments.
