<h2>Origin Story</h2>


<lzh>佛住王舍城。爾時樹提比丘尼欲與弟子受具足。語偷蘭難陀比丘尼言。阿梨耶。為我請僧與弟子受具足。後比丘尼僧與受具足。偷蘭難陀比丘尼請得六群比丘。樹提問言。為我請得僧未。答言已得。得誰答言。得六群比丘。語言。我不用。至明日更請善比丘受具足。
諸比丘尼語大愛道。大愛道即以是事往白世尊。佛言。喚是比丘尼來。來已問言。汝實爾不。答言實爾。佛言樹提。此是惡事。汝云何一眾清淨。已停宿受具足而復輕眾。從今日後。不聽一眾清淨停宿受具足。亦不聽輕眾。佛告大愛道瞿曇彌。依止王舍城比丘尼皆悉令集。乃至已聞者當重聞。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying in Rājagaha. At that time, Jetā bhikkhunī wanted to give her student the full ordination. She said to Thullanandā bhikkhunī: “Venerable, invite the (bhikkhu) sangha on my behalf to give the full ordination to my student.” Later the bhikkhunī sangha gave her the full ordination. Thullanandā bhikkkhunī invited and assembled (lit. obtained) the group-of-six bhikkhus. Jetā asked: “Have you invited and assembled the sangha on my behalf yet?” (Thullanandā) answered: “I’ve assembled them.” “Who have you assembled?” She answered: “I’ve assembled the group-of-six bhikkhus.” (Jetā) said: “I’m not going to use them. Tomorrow, I’ll invite good bhikkhus to give the full ordination.”
The bhikkhunīs told Mahāpajāpatī, and she went to the World-honored One, and informed him of this matter. The Buddha said: “Summon that bhikkhunī.” When she came, he asked her: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this.” The Buddha said: “Jetā, this is an unwholesome thing. Why did you wait overnight before giving the full ordination to someone who has been purified in one sangha? And you also slighted the (bhikkhu) sangha. From now on, it’s no longer allowed to wait overnight before giving the full ordination to someone who has been purified in one sangha. And it’s not allowed to slight the (bhikkhu) sangha.” The Buddha told Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī: “Convene all the bhikkhunīs living in the vicinity of Rājagaha. … Those who have already heard it should listen again:




<h2>Final Ruling</h2>


<lzh>若比丘尼一眾清淨停宿受具足波夜提。</lzh>

If a bhikkhunī waits overnight before giving the full ordination to someone who has been purified in one sangha, it’s a pācittiya.”




<h2>Explanation</h2>


<lzh>比丘尼者如上說。一眾清淨者。比丘尼眾中受具足。停宿者至明日。比丘眾中受具足波夜提。波夜提者如上說。不聽一眾清淨停宿受具足。復不聽輕眾。復不得請惡比丘眾與受具足。應當先求善比丘。若不可得當求半。若過半許而作羯磨。若王賊難。不得者停宿無罪。比丘亦不得輕眾。應得半。若過半而作羯磨。輕眾者得越毘尼罪。是故世尊說。</lzh>

“A bhikkhunī” is as explained above. “Purified in one sangha” means having received the full ordination in the bhikkhunī sangha. “Waiting overnight” means until the next day; if one then gives her the full ordination in the bhikkhu sangha, it’s a pācittiya. “Pācittiya” is as explained above. It’s not allowed to wait overnight before giving the full ordination to someone who has been purified in one sangha. It’s also not allowed to slight the (bhikkhu) sangha. And it’s not allowed to invite a sangha of bad monks to give the full ordination. One should first look for good bhikkhus. If one can’t assemble (enough), one should look for half, or more than half, of the required number to carry out the formal act. If there’s trouble caused by kings or criminals, and one can’t assemble (bhikkhus), one may wait overnight without offense. It’s not allowed for a bhikkhu to slight the sangha. He should carry out the formal act by assembling half, or more than half, of good bhikkhus. If he slights the sangha, he breaks a minor vinaya rule. This is what the World-honored One said.
