<h2>Origin Story</h2>


<lzh>佛住毘舍離。爾時跋陀羅伽比梨比丘尼往至親里家。敷高脚佉啁羅床褥兩三重登上。為世人外道所嫌。云何沙門尼出家。猶如俗人多欲如是。
諸比丘尼語大愛道。大愛道即以是事往白世尊。佛言。呼是比丘尼來。來已問言。汝實爾不。答言實爾。佛言。汝云何過量佉啁羅床上坐。從今已後不聽。佛告大愛道瞿曇彌。依止毘舍離比丘尼皆悉令集。乃至已聞者當重聞。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying at Vesāli. At that time, Bhaddā Kāpilānī bhikkhunī went to her relatives’ house and climbed on a high-footed couch bed on which two or three layers of mats were spread out. Laypeople and non-Buddhist renunciates were upset: “Why did this renunciate go forth? She’s like a lay person and has many such wishes.”
The bhikkhunīs told Mahāpajāpatī, and she went to the World-honored One, and informed him of this matter. The Buddha said: “Summon that bhikkhunī.” When she came, he asked her: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this.” The Buddha said: “Why did you sit on a couch bed that exceeds the measurements? From now on, it’s no longer allowed.” The Buddha told Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī: “Convene all the bhikkhunīs living in the vicinity of Vesāli. … Those who have already heard it should listen again:




<h2>Final Ruling</h2>


<lzh>若比丘尼過量佉啁羅床褥上若坐若臥波夜提。</lzh>

If a bhikkhunī sits or lies on a couch<note>khaṭvā</note> bed with mats that exceeds the measurements, it’s a pācittiya.”




<h2>Explanation</h2>


<lzh>比丘尼者如上說。過量者過八指。佉啁羅床褥者佉啁羅十四種。乃至崩求羅。佉啁崩求羅床。若坐若臥波夜提。波夜提者如上說。若竟日坐一波夜提。若起已更坐隨坐得波夜提。若過量床得埋脚坐。若比丘坐過量佉啁羅床上越毘尼罪。是故世尊說。</lzh>

“A bhikkhunī” is as explained above. “Exceeds the measurements” means more than eight fingerbreadths. “A couch bed with mats” means the fourteen kinds of couches: … a paṃgula<note>a couch covered with a piece of cloth</note>. If she sits or lies down on a paṃgula, it’s a pācittiya. “Pācittiya” is as explained above. If she sits down the whole day, it’s one pācittiya. If she gets up and then sits down again, she incurs a pācittiya whenever she sits down. If a bed exceeds the measurements, she may get the feet buried and then sit down. If a bhikkhu sits on a couch bed that exceeds the measurements, he breaks a minor vinaya rule. This is what the World-honored One said.
