Afterwards, (Thullanandā) didn’t give the full ordination. The sikkhamānā said: “Give me the full ordination.” In this way, it went on for a long time.
The bhikkhunīs told Mahāpajāpatī, and she then went to the World-honored One and informed him of this matter. The Buddha said: “Summon that bhikkhunī.” When she came, he asked her: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this.” The Buddha said: “This is an unwholesome thing. … ” The Buddha told Mahāpajāpatī: “Convene all the bhikkhunīs living in the vicinity of Sāvatthī. … Those who have already heard it should listen again:

“A bhikkhunī” is as explained above. “A sikkhamānā” means someone who has received the training precepts. “A robe” means the seven kinds of robes as explained above<note>This refers to the seven kinds of allowable robe material.</note>. Also, robes are the saṅghāṭī, … the rains bathing robe. If she agrees to give the full ordination, but later doesn’t give it herself, nor has others give it, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. “A nissaggiya pācittiya” is as explained above. If a bhikkhunī takes the sikkhamānā’s robe and agrees to give her the full ordination, she later should give it. If she’s old, sick, or without strength, and can’t give it, she should say to someone else: “Take this robe and give her the full ordination.” If the sikkhamānā doesn’t want to receive (ordination from that bhikkhunī) and asks to have the robe returned, it should be returned. If a bhikkhu agrees to a sāmaṇera’s request and then doesn’t give the full ordination, he breaks a minor vinaya rule. This is what the World-honored One said.
