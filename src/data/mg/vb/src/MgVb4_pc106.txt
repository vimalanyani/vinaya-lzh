<h2>Origin Story</h2>


<lzh>佛住舍衛城。爾時比丘尼年年度弟子受具足。心生疑惑。為得為不得。
即問大愛道。大愛道往白世尊。佛言。喚是比丘尼來。來已問言。汝實爾不。答言實爾。佛言。從今日後不聽年年度人受具足。當作間。佛告大愛道。依止舍衛城比丘尼皆悉令集。乃至已聞者當重聞。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī. At that time, a bhikkhunī gave the going forth to students every year, and gave them the full ordination. Doubt arose in her mind whether it was allowed or not.
Then she asked Mahāpajāpatī, and Mahāpajāpatī went to the World-honored One and informed him. The Buddha said: “Summon that bhikkhunī.” When she came, he asked her: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this.” The Buddha said: “From now on, it’s no longer allowed to give the going forth and the full ordination to people every year.

<lzh>年年者雨雨時。畜弟子者受具足。波夜提者如上說。不聽年年畜弟子。應作一雨時間。若比丘尼有福德。一年與學戒弟子。二年與受具足。雖年年無罪。是故世尊說。</lzh>

“Every year” means every rainy season. “Taking on a student” means giving the full ordination. “Pācittiya” is as explained above. It’s not allowed to take on students every year. One should keep an intervall of one rainy season. If a bhikkhunī has merit, she may give the training precepts to a student in one year, and give the full ordination in the second year. Although it’s every year, there’s no offense. This is what the World-honored One said.
