The Buddha was staying in Sāvatthī. At that time, bhikkhunīs in Vesāli had finished their rains retreat, and wanted to go to Sāvatthī to pay respect to the World-honored One. They went to a bhikkhu temple and said: “Venerables, we heard that the venerables want to go to Sāvatthī to pay respect to the World-honored One. Is that really so?” They answered: “Why do you ask?” “We want to come along.” The bhikkhus said: “The World-honored One has laid down a precept that it’s not allowed to wander on a road together with a bhikkhunī.” They asked again: “At what time will you set out?” The bhikkhus answered: “On such-and-such a day.” Then the bhikkhunīs noted down that day. Just before, they took their robes and bowls, and waited at the roadside. When the day came, the bhikkhus set out after eating. On seeing the bhikkhunīs, they spoke with each other: “These bhikkhunīs want to come along with us. We’ll walk quickly.” The young bhikkhunīs ran after them, and chased them. The old and sick bhikkhunīs, and those who originally came from wealthy families, couldn’t reach them. Afterwards, they were robbed by criminals.
The bhikkhunīs told Mahāpajāpatī, and for this reason, she went and informed the World-honored One. … “Summon those bhikkhunīs.” When they came, he asked them: “Did you really do this?” They answered: “We really did this.” The Buddha said: “Why did you wander to another country through empty, remote areas without a group of merchants? From now on, it’s no longer allowed.” The Buddha told Mahāpajāpatī: “Convene all the bhikkhunīs living in the vicinity of Sāvatthī. … Those who have already heard it should listen again:




<h2>Final Ruling</h2>


<lzh>若比丘尼無商人伴向異國行波夜提。</lzh>

If a bhikkhunī wanders to another country without a group of merchants, it’s a pācittiya.”




<h2>Explanation</h2>


<lzh>比丘尼者如上說。無伴者無商人伴。餘國者異王境界。去者波夜提。若比丘尼欲行時。當先求商人伴。若前人言。阿梨耶但來。我當料理使令得去。當相望其人。若語大善視瞻不好者。不應隨去。更求善人將女婦者共去。若去時卒不得善察。至逈處方覺者不得便捨去。當待近聚落已方便捨去。若問言欲那去。當語言。我乞食耳。若比丘尼無商人伴行者得越毘尼罪。至所在波夜提。若比丘於空逈無商人伴行者得越毘尼罪。是故世尊說。</lzh>

“A bhikkhunī” is as explained above. “Without a group” means without a group of merchants. “Another country” means another king’s territory. If she goes, it’s a pācittiya. When a bhikkhunī wants to wander, she should first ask a group of merchants. If the leader says: “Venerable, just come along. I’ll make proper arrangements to make it possible for you to come along,” she should examine that person. If his speech is highly virtuous but he looks like a bad person, she shouldn’t go with him. She should continue to look for a virtuous person accompanied by women, and go with them. If when she’s wandering, she suddenly finds out that he’s not virtuous, and they’ve reached a remote area when she notices it, she may not leave him immediately. She should wait until they’re close to a village, and leave him there. If he asks: “Where do you want to go?”, she should say: “I’m just going on almsround.” If a bhikkhunī wanders without a group of merchants, she breaks a minor vinaya rule. When she reaches her destination, it’s a pācittiya. If a bhikkhu wanders through empty, remote areas without a group of merchants, he breaks a minor vinaya rule. This is what the World-honored One said.
