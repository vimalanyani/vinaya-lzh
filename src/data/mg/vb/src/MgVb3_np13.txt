The Buddha was staying in Sāvatthī. At that time, Thullanandā bhikkhunī encouraged people to donate by preparing food, and said to some women: “Laywomen, I want to prepare food for the sangha.” The lay women rejoiced with faith in their minds, gave funds for food, and said: “Venerable, when the day of food preparation comes, tell us. We’ll come and serve it.” When the bhikkhunī had received it, she arranged food for herself, and bought robes and bowls. With the remainder, she prepared coarse food. On the day, she herself went and served the food. When (the lay women) saw this, they asked: “Venerables, we previously gave a lot of funds for food. Why is the food so coarse?” The bhikkhunīs said: “From where should we receive good food? (Thullanandā) only arranged robes, bowls, and food for herself.”
When the bhikkhunīs heard this, they told Mahāpajāpatī, and she went to the World-honored One, and informed him of this matter. The Buddha said: “Summon that bhikkhunī.” When she came, he asked her: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this.” The Buddha said: “This is an unwholesome thing. … ” The Buddha told Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī: “Convene all the bhikkhunīs living in the vicinity of Sāvatthī. … Those who have already heard it should listen again:

“A bhikkhunī” is as explained above. “For food” means to prepare food for the sangha. “Asking” means encouraging to donate, and requesting. “A different purpose” means for robes, bowls, and drinks and food for herself; this is a nissaggiya pācittiya. “A nissaggiya pācittiya” is as explained above. If a bhikkhunī asks for food to prepare for the sangha, but buys robes, bowls, drinks, and food for herself, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. It should be used according to the initial request. If it was designated for the early meal, and she uses it for the later meal; or if it was designated for the later meal, and she uses it for the early meal, she breaks a minor vinaya rule. If the fund was designated for food, and she uses it for beds and mats, (she breaks a minor vinaya rule). If one part is for spring, summer, or winter robes, and one part is for food, it should be used according to the original directions. But if she doesn’t follow the donor’s original intention for the gift, she breaks a minor vinaya rule. If a bhikkhunī encourages people to donate for the sangha, and receives food, she should use it all for that. If there are extra drinks, food, ghee, or oil, she should show them to the supporter. If the supporter takes them and leaves, she should keep silent. If they say: “I offer this to the venerable,” she should say: “Give it to the sangha.” If they reply: “I’ve already offered to the sangha. This is offered to the venerable,” and if she takes it then, there’s no offense. This is what was said.
