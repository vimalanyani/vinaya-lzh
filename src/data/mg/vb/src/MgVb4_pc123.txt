<h2>Origin Story</h2>


<lzh>佛住毘舍離。爾時跋陀羅比丘尼到親里家。與兄弟姊妹兒在闇處無燈。先不語卒爾而入。爾時親里羞慚。
諸比丘尼語大愛道。乃至答言。實爾。佛言。汝云何知男子在闇中無燈而入。從今已後不聽。乃至已聞者當重聞。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying in Vesāli. At that time, Bhaddā bhikkhunī went to her relatives’ house, and when her brothers’ and sisters’ sons were in a dark place without a lamp, she suddenly entered there without first announcing herself. Then her relatives felt ashamed.
The bhikkhunīs told Mahāpajāpatī, … She answered: “I really did this.” The Buddha said: “Why did you knowingly enter a place where men were staying in the dark without a lamp? From now on, it’s no longer allowed.” … Those who have already heard it should listen again:




<h2>Final Ruling</h2>


<lzh>若比丘尼知闇中有男子坐無燈而入波夜提。</lzh>

If a bhikkhunī knows that a man is sitting in the dark without a lamp, and enters there, it’s a pācittiya.”




<h2>Explanation</h2>


<lzh>比丘尼者如上說。男子坐者常眠臥處。闇處者不相見處。無燈者無油燈及餘種種燈。入者波夜提。波夜提者如上說。不得入闇地男子坐處。若有因緣事須入者。若聞內人高聲大聲當入。若不聞語者應先遣人語若彈指若作燈明現相。有人呼入者當入。若不語不彈指不作燈明而入者波夜提。若比丘不語而入者越毘尼罪。是故世尊說。</lzh>

“A bhikkhunī” is as explained above. “A man is sitting” means a place for sleeping and lying down. “A dark place” means a place where they can’t see each other. “Without a lamp” means without an oil lamp, … or any other kind of lamp. If she enters, it’s a pācittiya. “Pācittiya” is as explained above. One may not enter a dark place where a man is sitting. If there’s a reason why she has to enter, if she hears that the people inside are loud and noisy, she may enter. If she can’t hear voices, she should first send someone in to speak with them, or snap her fingers, or light a lamp to make each other visible. If people call out for her to enter, she may enter. If she doesn’t speak, doesn’t snap her fingers, and doesn’t light a bright lamp, and still enters, it’s a pācittiya. If a bhikkhu enters without speaking, he breaks a minor vinaya rule. This is what the World-honored One said.
