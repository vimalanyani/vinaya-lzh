<h2>Origin Story</h2>


<lzh>佛住舍衛城。爾時六群比丘尼共一床一敷眠。枕褥破裂床復折壞。
諸比丘尼以是因緣語大愛道。大愛道乃至佛言。呼是比丘尼來。來已佛言。汝實爾不。答言實爾。佛言。此是惡事。乃至佛告大愛道。依止舍衛城比丘尼皆悉令集。乃至已聞者當重聞。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying in Sāvatthī. At that time, group-of-six bhikkhunīs slept together on one bed and one mat. The pillow and the mat were torn, and the bed was also damaged.
For this reason, the bhikkhunīs spoke with Mahāpajāpatī, and she … The Buddha said: “Summon those bhikkhunīs.” When they came, he asked them: “Did you really do this?” They answered: “We really did this.” The Buddha said: “This is an unwholesome thing. … ” The Buddha told Mahāpajāpatī: “Convene all the bhikkhunīs living in the vicinity of Sāvatthī. … Those who have already heard it should listen again:




<h2>Final Ruling</h2>


<lzh>若比丘尼同敷床褥臥波夜提。</lzh>

<h2>Explanation</h2>


<lzh>敷者同一敷一覆一床。床者十四種。乃至脂蘭床波夜提。波夜提者如上說。不得同床臥。一床一人臥。三坐床得二人臥。展脚不得過膝。若方褥三褥得二人臥。展脚不得過膝。若地敷者不得多取。地當相去一不舒手。自敷坐具而臥。若寒時得上通覆於下人。各自別覆無罪。若比丘共床臥越毘尼罪。是故世尊說。</lzh>

“Laying out” means together on one mat, one cover, and one bed. “A bed” means the fourteen kinds: … a kilaṁja<note>a screened-off bed</note>; this is a pācittiya. “Pācittiya” is as explained above. One may not lie down together on a bed. On one bed, one person may lie down. On a bed of three seats, two people may lie down. When they stretch out their legs, they may not extend them further than a knee-length. If they lay out mats, then on three mats two people may lie down. When they stretch out their legs, they may not extend them further than a knee-length. If they lay it out on the ground, they may not take up too much space. They should each be separated, out of arm’s reach, and everyone should lay out their own sitting mat and lie down. If it’s winter, it’s allowed for several people to be under the same upper blanket, and if each one also has her own cover, there’s no offense. If bhikkhus sleep together on a bed, they break a minor vinaya rule. This is what the World-honored One said.
