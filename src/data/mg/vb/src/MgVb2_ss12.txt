<h2>Origin Story</h2>


<lzh>佛住王舍城。爾時世尊制戒。不聽漏心男子邊取衣鉢飲食疾病湯藥。時樹提比丘尼不取長者施衣。時偷蘭難陀比丘尼語樹提言。何不取此男子施。男子漏心不漏心何預人事。但使汝無漏心取已隨因緣用。諸比丘尼諫是比丘尼。莫作是語。男子漏心不漏心何預人事。但使汝無漏心可取此施隨因緣用。如是二諫三諫不止。
諸比丘尼以是事語大愛道。大愛道即以是事往白世尊。佛言。喚比丘尼來。來已佛問。汝實爾不。答言實爾。佛言。此是惡事。汝云何勸彼。取漏心人施。此非法非律不如佛教。不可以是長養善法。佛語大愛道。依止王舍城住比丘尼皆悉令集。乃至已聞者當重聞。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying at Rājagaha. At that time, the World-honored One had laid down the precept that it’s not allowed to receive robes, bowls, drinks, food, liquid remedies and medicines for the sick from a man with a defiled mind. So Jetā bhikkhunī didn’t receive the householder’s robe offering. Then Thullanandā bhikkhunī said to Jetā: “Why don’t you receive the offerings of this man? A man’s defiled or undefiled mind, how’s that anyone’s business? Just make your mind undefiled, then having accepted it, you can use it appropriately.” The bhikkhunīs admonished that bhikkhunī: “Don’t say this: ‘A man’s defiled or undefiled mind, how’s that anyone’s business? Just make your mind undefiled, then you may accept this offering and use it appropriately.’” Like this, they admonished her a second and a third time, but she didn’t stop.
The bhikkhunīs informed Mahāpajāpatī of this matter, and she went and informed the World-honored One. The Buddha said: “Summon that bhikkhunī.” When she came, the he asked her: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this.” The Buddha said: “This is an unwholesome thing. Why did you instruct her to receive an offering from a man with a defiled mind? This is against the dhamma, against the vinaya, against the Buddha’s teaching. One can’t develop in wholesome states like this.” The Buddha told Mahāpajāpatī: “Convene all the bhikkhunīs living in the vicinity of Rājagaha. … Those who have already heard it should listen again:




<h2>Final Ruling</h2>


<lzh>若比丘尼語比丘尼作是語。可取此男子施。漏心不漏心何預汝事。但汝莫漏心。可取施已隨因緣用。諸比丘尼應諫是比丘尼。莫作是語。應取是施。男子漏心不漏心何預人事。但使汝無漏心可取。施已隨因緣用。如是應第二第三諫。捨是事好。若不捨者。是法初罪僧伽婆尸沙。</lzh>

If a bhikkhunī says to another bhikkhunī: ‘You can receive the offering of this man. Defiled or undefiled mind, how’s that your business? As long as you don’t have a defiled mind, you may accept the offering, and use it appropriately,’ the bhikkhunīs should admonish that bhikkhunī: ‘Don’t say: ‘You should receive the offering. A man’s defiled or undefiled mind, how’s that anyone’s business? Just make your mind undefiled, then you may accept the offering, and use it appropriately,’ Like this she should be admonished a second and a third time. If she gives up this matter, it’s fine. If she doesn’t give it up, it’s an immediate saṅghādisesa offense.”<note>This is obviously not an immediate saṅghādisesa offense, but one after three admonishments. In the Sthāviravāda schools, the parallels to this rule are all immediate offenses. So it seems that this rule was later expanded to include three admonishments, but the text wasn’t fully adjusted.</note>




<h2>Explanation</h2>


<lzh>作是語比丘尼者。如偷蘭難陀比丘尼。取施者。如樹提比丘尼。諸比丘尼諫是比丘尼令捨是事。如不捨者是法乃至三諫。僧伽婆尸沙。是故世尊說。</lzh>

“A bhikkhunī who says” means like Thullanandā bhikkhunī. “Receiving the offering” means like Jetā bhikkhunī. The bhikkhunīs admonish this bhikkhunī to make her give up this matter. If she doesn’t give it up, this rule is a saṅghādisesa after three admonishments. This is what the World-honored One said.
