<beginh2>Origin Story<endh2>


<beginchinese>佛住舍衛城。爾時比丘尼共女人。共到園池處看。諸女人在水邊飲食。比丘尼往故村舍中看。時有諸年少從林中出擾亂比丘尼。
比丘尼語大愛道。乃至已聞者當重聞。<endchinese>

The Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī. At that time, a bhikkhunī went together with other women to visit a park with a pond. While the women were eating and drinking by the waterside, the bhikkhunī went to look at old cottages. Then some young men emerged from a grove, and molested the bhikkhunī.
The bhikkhunī told Mahāpajāpatī. … Those who have already heard it should listen again:




<beginh2>Final Ruling<endh2>


<beginchinese>若比丘尼自境界內。觀園林故墟波夜提。<endchinese>

If a bhikkhunī visits a park, a grove, or ancient ruins in her own country, it’s a pācittiya.”




<beginh2>Explanation<endh2>


<beginchinese>比丘尼者如上說。境界內者自王境內。園者菴婆羅園。乃至阿提目多園。林者種種林樹。故墟者空屋宅中。觀看去者波夜提。波夜提者如上說。若比丘尼往園林墟宅中看去時越毘尼罪。到彼波夜提。若檀越婦女請共去者無罪。若比丘往丘墟園林觀看為樂者越毘尼罪。是故世尊說。<endchinese>

“A bhikkhunī” is as explained above. “In her own country” means in her king’s realm. “A park” means a mango orchard, … an atimuttaka orchard. “A grove” means all kinds of tree groves. “Ancient ruins” means empty buildings. If she goes to visit these, it’s a pācittiya. “Pācittiya” is as explained above. If a bhikkhunī is on the way to see a park, a grove, or ruins, she breaks a minor vinaya rule. When she has arrived, it’s a pācittiya. If women supporters invite her to go together, there is no offense. If a bhikkhu goes to visit ruins, a park, or a grove for enjoyment, he breaks a minor vinaya rule. This is what the World-honored One said.
