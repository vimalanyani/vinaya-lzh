<h2>Origin Story</h2>


<lzh>佛住比舍離。爾時跋陀羅比丘尼於蘇河浴。爾時有五離車童子。於河上看。見已生欲心。比丘尼言。長壽汝去。答言我不去。欲看阿梨耶形體。比丘尼言。汝用看是臭爛身九孔門為。復言不爾。我甚欲見。良久不去。比丘尼作是念。此凡夫愚淺。即以手掩前後而出。其人見已迷悶倒地。血從口出。
諸比丘尼語大愛道。大愛道即以是事往白世尊。乃至諸比丘尼問佛。云何是五離車童子。有欲心迷悶倒地乃爾。佛言。非但今日有此欲心。過去世時已曾如是。諸比丘尼白佛言。願欲聞之。佛言。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying at Vesālī. At that time, Bhaddā bhikkhunī was bathing in the river Sarpiṇikā. There were five young Licchavis who were watching her from the river bank. Having seen her, desire arose in their minds. The bhikkhunī said: “Long-lived Ones, go away.” They answered: “We won’t go away. We wish to look at the venerable’s body.” The bhikkhunī said: “What’s the use of looking at this smelly, festering body with it’s nine openings?” They said again: “That’s not true. We deeply desire to look at it.” And they didn’t leave for a long time. The bhikkhunī thought: “These worldlings are foolish and shallow.” Then she came out covering herself in front and behind with her hands. When these men saw that, they fell on the ground in confusion, and blood streamed out of their mouths.
The bhikkhunīs told Mahāpajāpatī, and she went to the World-honored One, and informed him of this matter. … The bhikkhunīs asked the Buddha: “Why did these five young Licchavis have a lustful mind, and fell on the ground in confusion like this?” The Buddha said: “It’s not just today that they had a lustful mind. In the past, it was already like this.” The bhikkhunīs said to the Buddha: “We wish to hear of this.” The Buddha said:




<h2>Past Life Story</h2>


<lzh>過去久遠。爾時有一天女端正殊特。時有五天子。一名釋迦羅。二名摩多梨。三名僧闍耶帝。四名鞞闍耶帝。五名摩吒。見已各生欲心便作是念。此非可共物。欲心重者當以與之。各言可爾。於是釋迦羅即說頌曰。</lzh>

A long time ago, there was a graceful and exquisite goddess, and there were five gods. The first god was called Sakka, the second Mātali, the third King Sañjaya, the fourth King Vijaya, and the fifth Māta. When they saw her, desire arose in their minds and they all thought: “This isn’t an item we can share. She should be given to the one whose mind is most lustful.” Everyone agreed, and then Sakka spoke this verse:


<lzh>我憶婬欲時 坐臥不自安
乃至睡眠時 欲退始得安</lzh>

<verse>When I think of sexual desire, whether sitting or lying I won’t find peace.
Only when I’m asleep, the desire recedes and I begin to feel peace.</verse>


<lzh>摩多梨復說頌曰。</lzh>

Mātali then spoke this verse:


<lzh>釋迦汝眠時 猶故有暫泰
我憶婬慾時 如陣戰鼓音</lzh>

<verse>Sakka, when you sleep, you still gain momentary rest.
When I think of sexual desire, it’s like the sound of a drum on the battleground.</verse>


<lzh>僧闍耶帝復說頌曰。</lzh>

King Sañjaya then spoke this verse:


<lzh>摩多鼓音喻 猶故尚有間
我心染欲時 如駃流漂木</lzh>

<verse>Mātali’s analogy of a drum’s sound still has intervalls between.
When my mind is defiled with desire, it’s like a floating log swept away by a torrential river.</verse>


<lzh>鞞闍耶帝復說頌曰。</lzh>

King Vijaya then spoke this verse:


<lzh>汝喻漂浮木 或時有稽留
我憶欲念時 如虻虫不瞬</lzh>

<verse>Your analogy of a floating log will sometimes still get caught somewhere.
When I think thoughts of desire, they never stop, like gadflies.</verse>


<lzh>於是摩吒復說頌曰。</lzh>

And then Māta spoke this verse:


<lzh>汝等諸所說 全是安樂想
我耽婬欲時 不覺死與生</lzh>

<verse>All that you’ve spoken is full of comfortable ideas.
When I’m obsessed with sexual desire, I don’t know if I’m dead or alive.</verse>


<lzh>於是諸天子言。汝最重者即并與之。佛告諸比丘尼。爾時五天子者今五離車是。諸比丘尼白佛言。是比丘尼有何行業端正如是。在大姓家生。以信出家得證無漏。佛告諸比丘尼。過去世時有城名波羅奈。有長者家初取新婦。常有一梳頭人給與飲食。時有辟支佛名宣絺。詣門乞食。其婦見之不大端嚴無恭敬心。既不與食復不語去。梳頭人見已語言。新婦可施與食。答言。醜陋不好。我不能與。即語可賜我食分。我欲與之。答言隨意。亦可棄著水中。其人得食即施辟支佛。於是受食乘空而逝。見其飛騰心大歡喜即發誓言。願我後身生大姓家身體端正。見佛聞法得盡有漏。於是命終即生天上。於百千天女。五事最勝。壽命色力名稱辯才。天上命終生波羅奈城婆羅門家。值迦葉佛出世時。父母出行遊觀。時女在家。迦葉佛入城乞食次到其家。宿殖德故見大歡喜。淨洗銅盤盛種種好食及憍舍耶衣奉上世尊。即說頌曰。</lzh>

At that, the gods said: “You’re the most lustful, and we’ll give her to you.” The Buddha told the bhikkhunīs: “The five gods at that time are the five Licchavis now.” The bhikkhunīs asked the Buddha: “What karma did that bhikkhunī have to become as graceful as this, to be born in the household of a great family, to go forth out of faith, and to realize awakening without taints?” The Buddha told the bhikkhunīs: “In the past, there was a city called Vārāṇasī, and there was a householder who had just recently married his wife. She always had a hairdresser who offered food and drinks. Then a solitary Buddha called Ṡuṇṭhīka came to their door on almsround. When the wife saw that he wasn’t particularly good-looking, she didn’t feel respect in her mind. She also didn’t offer food, and left without speaking. When the hairdresser saw him, she said to the new wife: “You could offer food.” She answered: “He looks ugly, not good. I can’t offer anything.” (The hairdresser) then said: “Please give me my share of food. I wish to offer.” The wife answered: “As you wish. But you might as well throw it away into water.” The other woman got her food, and offered it to the solitary Buddha. When he had received the food, he rose up into the air, and left. When she saw him flying up, her mind was greatly elated, and she made this vow: “In a next existence, may I be born in the household of a great family, with a graceful body, see a Buddha, hear his dhamma, and attain the ending of the taints.” When that life was over, she was born in a heaven among 100.000 other goddesses. She had five things in the most superior way: Long life, beautiful appearance, strength, fame, and eloquence. When that life in heaven was over, she was born in Vārāṇasī into a brahmin household. At that time, it happened that Kassapa Buddha had appeared in the world. Her parents had gone out sightseeing, and the woman was at home. Kassapa Buddha entered the city on almsround in sequence, and reached that house. Because of the merit she had planted in the past life, she was overjoyed when she saw him. She offered that World-honored One a cleanly washed copper bowl abundantly filled with all kinds of good food, as well as a silk robe. The she spoke this verse:


<lzh>今奉食與衣 眾施中最勝
今供牟尼尊 結習盡得證
如是漏盡證 願我亦復然</lzh>

<verse>Today I offered food and a robe, the most splendid of all offerings,
Today I offered to a respected sage, who has exhausted afflictions and attained awakening.
This ending of the taints and awakening, I also wish to attain.</verse>


<lzh>此女後嫁適婆羅門家。姑妐嚴惡難事。乃至我用此活為。不如自殺。即持瓔珞及塗身香。并自絞繩。欲行自殺。過見迦葉佛塔。即持嚴身之具供養佛塔。然後自絞。命終之後即生婆羅門家。乃至自說頌曰。</lzh>

That woman later married into another brahmin household. Her parents-in-law were strict and evil, and there was much difficulty. … “What use do I’ve for this life? Why don’t I kill myself?” Then she took her necklace, and perfumed her body. With a rope to hang herself, she wanted to go and commit suicide. In passing, she saw the stupa of Kassapa Buddha. Then she took her adornments, and offered them to the stupa of the Buddha. Afterwards, she hung herself. When that life had ended, she was born into another brahmin household. … She spoke these verses:


<lzh>瓔珞衣香花 信供迦葉塔
緣此福報故 今禮世尊足</lzh>

<verse>A necklace, robes, perfumes, and flowers, I’ve offered with faith to the stūpa of Kassapa.
As a result of this merit, I now pay respect at the World-honored One’s feet.</verse>

<lzh>佛言。從今日後。應作浴衣。乃至已聞者當重聞。</lzh>

The Buddha said: “From now on, you should make a bathing robe.” … Those who have already heard it should listen again:




<h2>Final Ruling</h2>


<lzh>若比丘尼作雨浴衣。應量作。長四修伽陀搩手。廣二搩手。若過作截已波夜提。</lzh>

If a bhikkhunī makes a rains bathing robe, she should make it according to the measurements: four sugata handspans in length, two handspans in width. If she makes it larger, it’s to be cut off, and it’s a pācittiya.”
