<h2>Origin Story</h2>


<lzh>佛住舍衛城。爾時有比丘尼。不先看牆外。擲棄大小便。時有婆羅門。新洗浴著新淨衣巷中行。正墮頭上。婆羅門瞋罵言。眾多人子沙門尼。污我如是。
諸比丘尼往白佛。乃至答言。實爾世尊。佛言。此是惡事。汝云何不審諦觀而棄不淨。從今已後不聽。乃至已聞者當重聞。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying in Sāvatthī. At that time, a bhikkhunī threw excrement and urine over a wall without looking first. Then a brahmin, having freshly bathed and having put on new, clean clothes, was walking on a road, and the things fell straight on his head. The brahmin abused her: “Renunciate, you’re an ordinary person. You soiled me like this!”

“Partition wall” means screen, fence, or wall. “Throwing impure things” means excrement, urine, snot, spit, garbage, hand and foot washing water, hair, and fingernails. “Without observing” means throwing without looking first. If she wants to throw things away, she should first look properly. If many people walk there, she should wait until they’re gone before throwing. If there are few passer-bys, she should snap her fingers before throwing. If she throws without looking and without snapping her fingers, it’s a pācittiya. If a bhikkhu throws without looking, he breaks a minor vinaya rule. This is what the World-honored One said.
