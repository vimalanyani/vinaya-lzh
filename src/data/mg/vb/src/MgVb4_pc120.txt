<h2>Origin Story</h2>


<lzh>佛住毘舍離。爾時須闍提比丘尼。是優陀夷本二。語優陀夷言。尊者。我明日當守房可來看。時比丘尼盡入聚落乞食。時優陀夷著衣持鉢入比丘尼精舍。二人共在房後。各出身坐蹲踞相向欲心相視。時有老病比丘尼出欲便利。見已羞慚却行而去。
以是因緣語大愛道。乃至佛言。呼是比丘尼來。來已佛言。此是惡事。乃至已聞者當重聞。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying at Vesāli. At that time, Sujātā bhikkhunī had been Udāyī’s former wife. She said to Udāyī: “Venerable, tomorrow I’ll guard the monastery, you can come and visit me.” Then, the bhikkhunīs had all entered the village on almsround. Udāyī put on his robes, took his bowl, and entered the bhikkhunī monastery. The two stayed together behind the building, exposed their bodies, sat down and squatted, and looked at each other with a lustful mind. Then there was an old and sick bhikkhunī who came out wanting to relieve herself. When she saw them, she felt ashamed and went away.
For this reason, she spoke with Mahāpajāpatī, … The Buddha said: “Summon that bhikkhunī.” When she came, he said: “This is an unwholesome thing. … Those who have already heard it should listen again:




<h2>Final Ruling</h2>


<lzh>若比丘尼共一比丘空靜處坐波夜提。</lzh>

If a bhikkhunī sits together with one bhikkhu in an empty, quiet place, it’s a pācittiya.”




<h2>Explanation</h2>


<lzh>一者共一比丘更無人。設有人眠醉狂癡心亂苦痛嬰兒非人畜生。故名為一。空靜者避隈無人處。坐者共坐波夜提。波夜提者如上說。若比丘尼共比丘竟日坐一波夜提。若中間起還坐隨坐一一波夜提。若比丘尼獨在房中坐。卒有比丘來入坐者。比丘尼當速起。欲起時當先語。勿使比丘怪。若言何故起。當語。世尊制戒我不得共比丘獨坐。若減七歲男亦犯齊幾時名坐。如取食乞出家人頃。若有淨人。作事行來出入。不斷無罪。若房戶向道。有行人。不斷者無罪。若行人斷者波夜提。若淨人眠時當彈指令覺。若在閣上下人見。若在閣下上人見。三人展轉。相見無罪。或見非聞。或聞非見。或亦見亦聞。或非見非聞。見非聞者。遙見比丘比丘尼坐不聞語聲。聞非見者。聞語聲而不見。如是廣說見而不聞越毘尼罪。聞而不見亦越毘尼罪。見聞無罪。非見非聞波夜提。是罪亦聚落亦阿練若。亦晝亦是夜。亦時亦非時。是覆處非露處。是一人非眾多。是近處非遠處是故世尊說。</lzh>

“One” means together with one bhikkhu without other people. If the people who are there are asleep, drunk, distraught, deluded, overwhelmed by suffering and pain, young children, non-humans, or animals, it’s still called “one”. “Empty and quiet” means an avoided corner, a place without people. “Sitting” means sitting together; this is a pācittiya. “Pācittiya” is as explained above. If a bhikkhunī sits together along with a bhikkhu the whole day, it’s a pācittiya. If she gets up in between, returns, and sits down, then each time she sits down is another pācittiya. If a bhikkhunī sits alone in a building, and suddenly a bhikkhu enters and sits down, the bhikkhunī should get up quickly. When wanting to get up, she should first speak with him, so as not to make the bhikkhu feel strange. If he asks: “Why do you get up?”, she should say: “The World-honored One has laid down a precept that I’m not allowed to sit together alone with a bhikkhu.” If a boy is below seven years old, it’s still an offense. How much time is called “sitting”? The short while that it takes to fetch food for a renunciate on almsround. If there’s an attendant who is doing some work, constantly coming and going, entering and leaving, there’s no offense. If the building door faces the street and there constantly are passer-bys, there’s no offense. If there are only occasionally passer-bys, it’s a pācittiya. If the attendant is asleep, one should snap one’s fingers to wake her up. If they’re on the top of the temple building and a person below can see them, or if they’re at the bottom of the temple building and a person above can see them, and the three of them can see each other, there’s no offense. They may be visible but inaudible; or audible but invisible; or both visible and audible; or neither visible nor audible. “Visible but not audible” means seeing the bhikkhu and the bhikkhunī sitting from a distance, but not hearing the sound of their speech. “Audible but not visible” means hearing the sound of their speech, but not seeing them. In this way, (the other two cases) should be explained in detail. If they’re visible but inaudible, she breaks a minor vinaya rule. If they’re audible but invisible, she also breaks a minor vinaya rule. If they’re visible and audible, there’s no offense. If they’re invisible and inaudible, it’s a pācittiya. It’s an offense, both in a village and in the wilderness, during daytime and at night, at the right time and at the wrong time, in a hidden place, not in the open, if she’s with one man, not if she’s with a group, if they’re close together, not if they’re far apart. This is what the World-honored One said.
