<h2>Origin Story</h2>


<lzh>佛住拘睒彌。闡陀母比丘尼。諸比丘尼共法中。如法如比尼教。當學莫犯自身作不可共語。如闡陀戾語中廣說。乃至</lzh>

The Buddha was staying in Kosambī. When Chandamātā bhikkhunī was taught by bhikkhunīs of the same affiliation according to dhamma and vinaya: “You should train like this, don’t transgress,” she made herself unapproachable for talking together. As explained in detail in “Chanda’s contrary speech”. …




<h2>Final Ruling</h2>


<lzh>若比丘尼自用戾語。諸比丘尼共法中。如法如律教。便自用意作是言。汝莫語我若好若惡。我亦不語汝若好若惡。諸比丘尼應諫彼比丘尼言。阿梨耶。諸比丘尼共法中如法如律教汝莫自用。諸比丘尼教汝。汝當信受。汝亦應如法如律教諸比丘尼。何以故。如來弟子中展轉相教展轉相諫。共罪中出故。善法得增長故。是比丘尼。諸比丘尼諫時。堅持不捨者。應第二第三諫。捨是事善。若不捨是法乃至三諫。僧伽婆尸沙。</lzh>

If a bhikkhunī speaks obstinately and contrarily when bhikkhunīs of the same affiliation teach her in accordance with dhamma and vinaya, and with obstinate intentions, says: ‘Don’t say whether I’m good or bad. I also don’t say whether you’re good or bad,’ the bhikkhunīs should admonish that bhikkhunī: ‘Venerable, don’t act obstinately when the bhikkhunīs of the same affiliation teach you according to dhamma and vinaya. When the bhikkhunīs teach you, you should accept it faithfully. You should also teach the bhikkhunīs according to dhamma and vinaya. Why? The disciples of the Tathāgata teach each other and admonish each other, to come out of shared offenses and to achieve growth in wholesome states.’ If that bhikkhunī when admonished by the bhikkhunīs persists firmly, and doesn’t give it up, she should be admonished a second and a third time. If she gives up this matter, it’s fine. If not, this rule is a saṅghādisesa after three admonishments.”
