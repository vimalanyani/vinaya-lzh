<h2>Origin Story</h2>


<lzh>佛住舍衛城。爾時伽梨比丘尼受僧房已閉戶而去。後客比丘尼上座來次第與房。見戶閉即嫌言。此僧房舍何以閉戶而去。
諸比丘尼語大愛道。乃至佛言呼是比丘尼來。來已問言。汝實爾不。答言實爾。佛言。此是惡事。乃至汝云何僧房舍不捨閉戶而行。從今已後不聽。佛告大愛道。依止舍衛城比丘尼皆悉令集。乃至已聞者當重聞。</lzh>

The Buddha was staying in Sāvatthī. At that time, Kālī bhikkhunī, after having been assigned a sangha room, locked the door and went away. Then senior guest bhikkhunīs arrived, and were given rooms in order of their seniority. When they saw that the door was locked, they were upset and said: “In a sangha building, how can you lock the door, and go away?”

“A bhikkhunī” is as explained above. “The sangha’s bed and mat” means seats, beds, pillows, mats, and blankets. “Not giving up” means not returning, and not telling someone. If she goes to another place, is a pācittiya. “Pācittiya” is as explained above. If a bhikkhunī wants to go away, she should give up her bed and mat, or inform the person in charge of beds and mats before leaving. If she doesn’t give them up and goes away, it’s a pācittiya. If the room isn’t empty, and others still live there, she breaks a minor vinaya rule. This is what the World-honored One said.
