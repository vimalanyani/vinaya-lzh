        "The Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī. (At that time,) the wall separating the bhikkhunī monastery from a residence of non-Buddhist nuns collapsed. Then Thullanandā bhikkhunī said to the non-Buddhist nuns: “You should repair it. You’re shameless people. Your followers come and go, and walk around naked. Our group is virtuous and conscientious. Seeing you, our defilements increase.” They answered: “Now is the rainy season, and it can’t be done. Wait until the rainy season is over, and we’ll do it.” The bhikkhunī said: “You’ll do it immediately, you can’t wait until later.” They said: “We can’t do it.” The bhikkhunī said angrily: “Short-lived Ones, donkeys feeding on alcoholic dregs, you dare not to do it! Shameless, unconscientious, wrong-viewed, faithless people! Go and deal with it fast!” The non-Buddhist nuns scolded her: “You ordinary person, large-bellied renunciate, you’ll kill us next. In the end, we won’t do it for you at all.” Then the bhikkhunī went to the judge, and fully explained this matter to him: “Long-lived One, order them to rebuild the separation wall for me.” The judge had faith in the Buddha’s dhamma, so he then issued a summons for the non-Buddhist nuns, and had them come. When they came, he said: “Evil short-lived Ones, donkeys feeding on alcoholic dregs, wrong-viewed non-Buddhists, how can you not redo the separation wall? You’re shameless, and walk around naked. These are venerable celibate people. If they see you, their defilements increase. Quickly go and do it! If you don’t do it, it’ll be added to your crimes.” Then the non-Buddhist nuns did it. When they rebuilt it during the day, the rain at night destroyed it again. In this way, they worked for the three summer months but couldn’t accomplish it. So the non-Buddhist renunciates rebuked them and said to the lay Buddhists: “Look at your field of merit! Relying on the authority of the judge, they sent us out to work for three month in the mud.” When the lay Buddhist’s wives heard this, they told the bhikkhunīs.",
        "When the bhikkhunīs heard this, they told Mahāpajāpatī, and she fully informed the World-honored One of this matter. The Buddha said: “Summon that bhikkhunī.” When she came, he asked her: “Thullanandā, did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this.” The Buddha said: “This is an unwholesome thing. Why did you dispute with them? This is against the dhamma, against the vinaya, against the Buddha’s teaching. One can’t develop in wholesome states like this.” The Buddha told Mahāpajāpatī: “Convene all the bhikkhunīs living in the vicinity of Sāvatthī. For 10 benefits, I lay down a precept for the bhikkhunīs. … Those who have already heard it should listen again:"

        "“A bhikkhunī” is as explained above. “Filing a court case” means verbally filing a court case. “Laypeople” means householders. “Renunciates” means non-Buddhist renunciates, … matted-hair ascetics<note>Jaṭilas</note>. “All day” means until sunset. “A moment” means … even just a moment, an instant. Or even just with sāmaṇeras and monastery attendants. “Immediate offense” means one doesn’t wait for three admonishments. “Saṅgha-” means the eight pārājikas. “-adisesa” means that (unlike the pārājikas) this offense has a remainder, and the sangha should deal with it through a formal act. Therefore it’s said “a saṅghādisesa”. Another explanation is that because this matter is disclosed and confessed in the midst of the sangha, it’s called a saṅghādisesa. If a bhikkhunī goes to a judge at the king’s court, and speaks with them about others, it’s a saṅghādisesa. If she explains something, it’s a thullaccaya. If she goes to a lay Buddhist’s family or to a faithful family to explain something, she breaks a minor vinaya rule. If she’s upset in her mind, she transgresses against vinaya and should mentally repent. If a bhikkhu<note>The text says bhikkhunī, but it’s a mistake.</note> goes to the king’s court to speak about others, he breaks a minor vinaya rule. If he speaks when he’s upset, he transgresses against vinaya and should mentally repent. This is what the World-honored One said."
