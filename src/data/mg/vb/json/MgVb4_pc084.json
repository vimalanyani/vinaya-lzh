        "佛住舍衛城。爾時比舍佉鹿母請二部僧。時比丘尼晨朝往到其家語優婆夷言。汝今日請二部僧。我等當以何報之。鹿母言。阿梨耶。但誦經行道。便是報恩。答言實爾。然復更以餘事薄報。即共上閣取其劫貝。中有擘者。有紛者。中有紡者。成縷丸已而與之言。我欲報者今以作竟。優婆夷言此事非是報。欲報者食已坐禪受經誦經。是乃為報。",
        "諸比丘尼聞已語大愛道。大愛道以是事具白世尊。佛言。呼是比丘尼來。來已問言。汝實爾不。答言實爾。佛言。此是惡事。從今日後。不聽於白衣家作世俗作。佛告大愛道瞿曇彌。依止舍衛城比丘尼皆悉令集。乃至已聞者當重聞。"

        "The Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī. At that time, Visākhā Migāramātā had invited both sanghas. Then a bhikkhunī went to her house in the morning and said to the lay woman: “You’ve invited both sanghas for today. How can we repay that?” Migāramātā said: “Venerable, just recite suttas and practise the path. That’ll repay my kindness.” She replied: “That’s true. Still we’ll make a small repayment with something else.” Then they took her cotton to the top of the temple building. Some plucked it, some carded it, some spun it. When they had finished the balls of thread, they told her: “We wish to repay you, so we have now finished this.” The lay woman said: “This thing isn’t a repayment. If you wish to repay me, then after eating, you should do sitting meditation, learn suttas, and recite them. That would be a repayment.”",
        "When the bhikkhunīs heard this, they told Mahāpajāpatī, and she fully informed the World-honored One of this matter. The Buddha said: “Summon those bhikkhunīs.” When they came, he asked them: “Did you really do this?” They answered: “We really did this.” The Buddha said: “This is an unwholesome thing. From now on, it’s no longer allowed to do worldly activities for lay families.” The Buddha told Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī: “Convene all the bhikkhunīs living in the vicinity of Sāvatthī. … Those who have already heard it should listen again:"

        "“A bhikkhunī” is as explained above. “Laypeople” means white-clothed families. “Working for lay people” means plucking, carding, and spinning cotton, or pounding, scrubbing, and washing clothes. If she does such work for lay families, it’s a pācittiya. “Pācittiya” is as explained above. A bhikkhunī may not work for lay people. If because a supporter wants to make an offering to the Buddha, they say: “Venerable, help me to make the items for the offering,” then she may help to tye flower garlands, or grind inscence. If a bhikkhu helps lay people to do work, he breaks a minor vinaya rule. This is what the World-honored One said."
