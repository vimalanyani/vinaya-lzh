        "The Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī. At that time, the World-honored One had laid down the precept that someone who has 12 full rains and fulfills the 10 requirements may take on a student. Then a bhikkhunī who had 12 full rains and fulfilled the 10 requirements took on a student. The bhikkhunīs were upset and said: “That you’ve 12 full rains and fulfill the 10 requirements, who can know that?”",

This is called “without a formal act”. If she doesn’t fulfill the 10 requirements, it’s also called “without a formal act,” even if she carried out the formal act. If the motion isn’t complete, or if the assembly isn’t complete, or if the announcements aren’t complete, all these are called “without a formal act”. “Taking on students” means giving the full ordination. Giving the full ordination without a formal act is a pācittiya. This is what the World-honored One said."
