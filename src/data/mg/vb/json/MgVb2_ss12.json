        "The Buddha was staying at Rājagaha. At that time, the World-honored One had laid down the precept that it’s not allowed to receive robes, bowls, drinks, food, liquid remedies and medicines for the sick from a man with a defiled mind. So Jetā bhikkhunī didn’t receive the householder’s robe offering. Then Thullanandā bhikkhunī said to Jetā: “Why don’t you receive the offerings of this man? A man’s defiled or undefiled mind, how’s that anyone’s business? Just make your mind undefiled, then having accepted it, you can use it appropriately.” The bhikkhunīs admonished that bhikkhunī: “Don’t say this: ‘A man’s defiled or undefiled mind, how’s that anyone’s business? Just make your mind undefiled, then you may accept this offering and use it appropriately.’” Like this, they admonished her a second and a third time, but she didn’t stop.",
        "The bhikkhunīs informed Mahāpajāpatī of this matter, and she went and informed the World-honored One. The Buddha said: “Summon that bhikkhunī.” When she came, the he asked her: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this.” The Buddha said: “This is an unwholesome thing. Why did you instruct her to receive an offering from a man with a defiled mind? This is against the dhamma, against the vinaya, against the Buddha’s teaching. One can’t develop in wholesome states like this.” The Buddha told Mahāpajāpatī: “Convene all the bhikkhunīs living in the vicinity of Rājagaha. … Those who have already heard it should listen again:"

        "If a bhikkhunī says to another bhikkhunī: ‘You can receive the offering of this man. Defiled or undefiled mind, how’s that your business? As long as you don’t have a defiled mind, you may accept the offering, and use it appropriately,’ the bhikkhunīs should admonish that bhikkhunī: ‘Don’t say: ‘You should receive the offering. A man’s defiled or undefiled mind, how’s that anyone’s business? Just make your mind undefiled, then you may accept the offering, and use it appropriately,’ Like this she should be admonished a second and a third time. If she gives up this matter, it’s fine. If she doesn’t give it up, it’s an immediate saṅghādisesa offense.”<note>This is obviously not an immediate saṅghādisesa offense, but one after three admonishments. In the Sthāviravāda schools, the parallels to this rule are all immediate offenses. So it seems that this rule was later expanded to include three admonishments, but the text wasn’t fully adjusted.</note>"
