        "The Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī. At that time, the World-honored One had laid down the precept that isn’t allowable to take on a student when one has less than 12 rains. Then bhikkhunīs of the group-of-six and other bhikkhunīs, who had 12 full rains, but didn’t fulfill the 10 requirements, took on students. They didn’t teach and instruct them, and they were like heavenly cows and goats, … they didn’t know how to wear the robes and hold the bowl.",
        "The bhikkhunīs informed Mahāpajāpatī of this matter. … They answered: “We really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha said: “From now on, it’s no longer allowed for someone who doesn’t fulfill the 10 requirements to take on students.” The Buddha told Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī: “Convene all the bhikkhunīs living in the vicinity of Sāvatthī. … Those who have already heard it should listen again:"

        "“A bhikkhunī” is as explained above. “Twelve full rains” is as explained above. “Not fulfilling the 10 requirements” means that the 10 requirements aren’t complete. Which 10? 1: Keeping precepts. 2: Having learned much of the abhidhamma. 3: And of the vinaya. 4: Training in the precepts. 5: Training in samādhi. 6: Training in wisdom. 7: Can clear offenses herself, and can help others to clear offenses. 8: When a student or a relative wants to disrobe, she’s able to either go to them herself or to send someone. 9: Is able to look after sick students or have others look after them. 10: Has 12 full rains or more. These are called the 10 requirements. If someone who doesn’t fulfill the 10 requirements gives the going forth to a student, she breaks a minor vinaya rule. If she gives the full ordination, it’s a pācittiya. If a bhikkhu who doesn’t fulfill the 10 requirements gives the going forth to someone, he breaks a minor vinaya rule. This is what the World-honored One said."
