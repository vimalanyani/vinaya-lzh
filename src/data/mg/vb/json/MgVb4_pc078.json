        "佛住比舍離。爾時跋陀羅比丘尼家中常與送食。得已更煎更熬更調和。其兄弟伯叔來見已言我欲食。答言可爾。即取而食。覺氣味異常。問言何處得此好食。答言故是家中所送耳。即便恚言。我家從來作食徒棄錢財初不得好食。即還家鞭打奴婢罵言。虛棄錢物而不可食。其使人瞋恚言。坐此比丘尼。得苦惱如是。諸比丘尼聞已語大愛道。大愛道即以是事往白世尊佛言。呼跋陀羅比丘尼來。來已問言。汝實爾不。答言實爾。佛言。此是惡事。"

        "The Buddha was staying at Vesālī. At that time, Bhaddā bhikkhunī’s family often sent her food. When she received it, she fried, boiled, and seasoned it again. When her brothers and uncles came to see her, they said: “We’d like some food.” She answered: “Okay.” Then they took and ate it, and noticed that the smell and the flavor were exceptional. They asked: “Where did you get this good food from?” She answered: “It was just my old family who sent it.” Then they said angrily: “The cooks in our home always waste much money, and we still don’t get good food.” They then returned home, whipped and beat the slaves, and scolded them: “You waste money in vain, and we still can’t eat.” These people became resentful, and said: “Because of that bhikkhunī, we incured suffering and vexation like this.” When the bhikkhunīs heard this, they told Mahāpajāpatī, and she went to the World-honored One, and informed him of this matter. The Buddha said: “Summon Bhaddā bhikkhunī.” When she came, he asked her: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this.” The Buddha said: “This is an unwholesome thing."

        "Another time, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī. Then there were bhikkhunīs from the Sakyan and Mallan clans. When they went on almsround, they received rice, curries, and vegetables leftover from the day before. When they ate it, they vomited. The bhikkhunīs told Mahāpajāpatī, and she went and asked the World-honored One: “May we obtain permission to reheat food?” The Buddha said: “You may.” The Buddha told Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī: “Convene all the bhikkhunīs living in the vicinity of Vesālī.<note>Should read “Sāvatthī.</note>” … Those who have already heard it should listen again:"

        "“Staple food” means the five kinds of staple foods.<note>Pāli: khādanīya.</note> “Non-staple food” means the five kinds of non-staple foods.<note>Pāli: bhojanīya.</note> “Cooking again” means she either cooks herself or has others cook. “Boiling” means she either boils herself or has others boil. “Frying” means she either fries herself or has others fry. “Sick” means the World-honored One said there is no offense. What is “sick?” Old age, sickness, being weak and thin, eating cold food, vomiting, being uncomfortable. If a bhikkhunī who isn’t sick cooks food and eats it, it’s a pācittiya. “Pācittiya” is as explained above. It’s not allowed to boil or fry again to make the food nicer. If it’s cold, it may be reheated. It’s not allowed to cook in a pan or a pot. She should use a copper bowl, an earthen bowl, or a brass vessel to reheat things. <note>It seems that the Buddha didn’t allow the use of lay people’s cooking utensils. Instead, almsbowls made from unallowable materials, such as copper bowls (銅盂 — tāmra-pātra), earthen bowls (鉤鉢 — kupātra) and brass vessels (鍵鎡 — kāṁsika) were to be used. Maybe such bowls accumulated in the monasteries because lay people didn’t know that only clay (瓦鉢) and iron almsbowls (鐵鉢) were allowed, and so the monastics were to make use of them in other ways.</note> If a bhikkhu cooks, boils, or fries food again to make it nicer, he breaks a minor vinaya rule. If he informs attendants, there is no offense. If the food is cold when he goes on almsround, and he reheats it, there is no offense. This is what the World-honored One said."
