        "The Buddha was staying at Rājagaha. At that time, the bhikkhunī sangha had gathered, and wanted to carry out the formal act of the uposatha. Then Jetā bhikkhunī didn’t come. The sangha sent a message to summon her, saying: “Venerable, the bhikkhunī sangha has gathered and wants to carry out the uposatha. Please come.” Jetā said: “The World-honored One has laid down a precept that someone who is pure in the mundane world obtains the uposatha. I therefore am pure, and don’t need to go.”",
        "For this reason, Mahāpajāpatī fully informed the World-honored One. … She answered: “I really did this.” The Buddha said: “This is an unwholesome thing. … If you don’t respect the uposatha, then who will respect it?” … Those who have already heard it should listen again:"

        "“Purity uposatha” means on the fourteenth or the fifteenth day. If a bhikkhunī who isn’t sick doesn’t attend and respect the uposatha, it’s a pācittiya. “Sick” means old, weak, sick, taking medicine, having cut her head and bleeding, or taking ghee. Then she should send her purity and consent. If she’s not sick and doesn’t attend, or if she’s sick and doesn’t send her purity and consent, it’s a pācittiya. If a bhikkhunī doesn’t attend the uposatha, or when sick doesn’t sent purity and consent, it’s a pācittiya. If a bhikkhu doesn’t attend the uposatha, or when sick doesn’t send consent, he breaks a minor vinaya rule. This is what the World-honored One said."
