        "The Buddha was staying at Vesāli. At that time, Bhaddā Kāpilānī bhikkhunī rode in a nice, high vehicle to go to her relatives’ house. Laypeople were upset: “Why do these renunciates go forth? They ride in nice, high vehicles like lay people, and have many such wishes.”",
        "When the bhikkhunīs heard this, they told Mahāpajāpatī, and she fully informed the World-honored One of this matter. The Buddha said: “Summon that bhikkhunī.” When she came, he asked her: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this.” The Buddha said: “This is an unwholesome thing."

        "“A bhikkhunī” is as explained above. “Sick” means old, weak, or sick, or if ladies from wealthy families can’t walk. In these cases, the World-honored One said that there is no offense. “A vehicle” means the eight kinds: … and a boat as vehicle; these are called the eight kinds. “Riding” means that she commits a pācittiya. It’s not allowed for a bhikkhunī who isn’t sick to ride in a vehicle. When she’s sick, she may not ride on a cart (drawn by) only oxen. She may ride on a cart (drawn by) cows, or ride female horses, or female camels. If she’s sick, and can’t discern if the animal is female or male, there is no offense. If she rides on a boat to cross over a river, there is no offense. She may go upstream or downstream if she has matters to attend to. If a bhikkhu who isn’t sick rides in a vehicle, he breaks a minor vinaya rule. This is what the World-honored One said."
