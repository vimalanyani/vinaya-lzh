        "The Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī. At that time, a bhikkhunī was walking on road, and when it got dark, she reached a village, and looked for a place to spend the night. She came to one house, and said to the woman: “Give me a place to spend the night.” The woman said: “My husband has gone out, and might return when it’s dark.” The bhikkhunī again insisted that she put her up, and said: “He might not come, so you can put me up for one night.” Then she was given a place to stay. When it was dark, the husband returned and, bound by defilements, he had sex with his wife. The bhikkhunī hadn’t yet overcome desire. When she heard the noises, she was uncomfortable. When she had returned, she told the other bhikkhunīs.",
        "The bhikkhunīs told Mahāpajāpatī, … The Buddha said: “Summon that bhikkhunī.” When she came, he asked her: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this.” The Buddha said: “Why did you knowingly spend the night in a place used for sex in a family that’s having sex (lit. is eating)?"

Young men came, and assaulted and raped them.",

        "“A bhikkhunī” is as explained above. “Knowingly” means she either knows herself or hears it from others. “Eating” means a woman is a man’s food, a man is a woman’s food. “A family” means the four classes. “A place used for sex” means the place where husband and wife spend the night. Except at a suitable time, this is a pācittiya. At a suitable time, the World-honored One has said that there’s no offense: When it’s windy or rainy, when killing is going on, when dubious men are threatening to rape her, this is called a suitable time. One may not knowingly spend the night in a place used for sex in a family that’s having sex. If she’s in doubt whether there are heedless men in the village, and she stays in such a house out of fear, there’s no offense. This is what the World-honored One said."
