        "佛住舍衛城。爾時有半耆蒜商人。請比丘尼僧與蒜。時六群比丘尼就園噉蒜。踐蹈狼藉。時商人來行蒜。見此狼藉即問園民。何故乃爾。答言。前請比丘尼與蒜或就中食或持去。踐蹈如是。商人嫌言。我請與蒜但當食之。何故持去踐蹈如是。諸比丘尼聞已語大愛道。大愛道即以是事具白世尊。乃至答言實爾。佛語比丘尼。此是惡事。從今已後不聽食蒜。乃至已聞者當重聞。"

        "The Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī. At that time there was Meghīya, a garlic merchant, who invited the bhikkhunī sangha to give them garlic. Then the group-of-six bhikkhunīs went to the garden to eat garlic, trampling it, and making a mess. Then the merchant came to trade garlic, saw that it was a mess, and asked the gardeners: “Why is it like this?” They answered: “The bhikkhunīs you earlier invited to give them garlic came, ate some here, and took some away. They made this mess.” The merchant became angry and said: “I invited them to give them garlic, but only for eating here. Why did they take some away, and made this mess?” When the bhikkhunīs heard this, they told Mahāpajāpatī, and she fully informed the World-honored One of this matter. … They answered: “We really did this.” The Buddha said to the bhikkhunīs: “This is an unwholesome thing. From now on, it’s no longer allowed to eat garlic.” … Those who have already heard it should listen again:"

        "“A bhikkhunī” is as explained above. “Garlic” means planted garlic and (wild) mountain garlic. Similarly, all kinds of garlic may not be eaten. Both cooked and raw garlic aren’t allowed. Reheated garlic and garlic burnt to ashes are also not allowed. If the body has a wound, it’s allowed to apply it. When one has applied it, one must stay in a secluded place. When the wound has healed and been washed clean, one is allowed to return. This is what the World-honored One said."
