        "The Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī. At that time, Rāṣṭrapālā’s elder sister had died. She asked for various kinds of food and drinks, which she gave to her sister’s children. Lay people became angry: “Why does a renunciate accept other people’s gifts of faith and give them to lay people?” When the bhikkhunīs heard this, they told Mahāpajāpatī, and she fully informed the World-honored One of this matter. The Buddha said: “Summon that bhikkhunī.” When she came, he asked her: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this.” The Buddha said:"

        "At another time, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī. At that time, Gartodara, the non-Buddhist renunciate, came to his mother. When she saw him coming, she filled an almsbowl with various kinds of food and drinks and offered it to him. When her son had received it, he took it, and went to a bar to eat. He also gave some to others to eat. People asked him: “Where did you get this good food?” He said: “Keep it quiet. Lay people take (Buddhist) renunciates as a field of merit. A (Buddhist) renunciate then has taken me as a field of merit.” The lay people became angry: “Why does a renunciate use people’s gift of faith and give it to a place where merit doesn’t increase?” When the bhikkhunīs heard this, they told Mahāpajāpatī, and she went to the World-honored One, and informed him of this matter. The Buddha said: “Summon that bhikkhunī.” When she came, he asked her: “Did you really do this?” She answered: “I really did this.” The Buddha said: “This is an unwholesome thing. Why did you give food to non-Buddhist renunciates with your own hands? From now on, it’s no longer allowed to give food to non-Buddhist renunciates with one’s own hands.” The Buddha told Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī: “Convene all the bhikkhunīs living in the vicinity of Sāvatthī. … Those who have already heard it should listen again:"

        "“A bhikkhunī” is as explained above. “Lay people” means householders. “Non-Buddhist renunciates” means those gone forth in another religion. “With one’s own hands” means giving with the hand, receiving with the hand, giving with a utensil, receiving with a utensil. “Food” means staple and non-staple food. “Pācittiya” is as explained above. If a bhikkhunī has relatives who come and ask to be given food, it’s not allowed to give it with her own hands. She should have an attendant give it. If there’s no attendant, she should say: “Help yourself to food from here.” If she fears that they’ll take too much, she should say: “Take what you need, and put down the rest.” What she has obtained may be placed on the ground for them to pick up themselves. If a non-Buddhist renunciate comes, it’s not allowable to give with her own hands. She should have an attendant give it. If there’s no attendant, she should say: “Help yourself to food from here.” If she fears that they’ll take too much, she should say: “Take what you need, and put the rest here.” What she holds in her hands may be given by placing it on the ground. If the relatives become angry and say: “You act as though you were meeting with untouchables,” she should say: “The place you went forth at is no good. The World-honored One laid down a precept that it’s not allowed to give.” It’s allowed to have a non-Buddhist prepare food, and tell them: “Offer to me, and eat the rest yourself.” This is what the World-honored One said."
