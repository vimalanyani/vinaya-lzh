It is appropriate that we single-mindedly carry out the uposatha, and recite the pātimokkha together. This is the motion. Venerables, now we will do the uposatha, and recite the pātimokkha. May the sangha single-mindedly listen well. Those who have an offense should disclose it. If you have no offense, you should remain silent. By your silence I will know that the venerables are pure. When I call out three times in the midst of the bhikkhunī assembly, it is the same as if the bhikkhunīs were cross-examined individually. If a bhikkhunī, when I call out like this in the midst of the bhikkhunī assembly a second and a third time, remembers that she has an offense, but doesn’t disclose it, she incurs the offense of intentional lying. Venerables, the Buddha has said that the offense of intentional lying obstructs the dhamma path. A bhikkhunī who desires purification herein, and remembers an offense, should disclose it. Disclosing it leads to peace. Through hiding and not disclosing it, the offense increases. Venerables, I have recited the introduction to the pātimokkha. Now I ask the venerables: ‘Are you pure herein?’ A second and a third time, I ask this. The venerables are pure herein, therefore you are silent. This matter is remembered thus."

The pātimokkha doesn’t say whether it is immediate or after three admonishments, which is very unusual. In the Sthāviravāda schools, the parallels to this rule are all immediate offenses.

When that bhikkhunī needs a robe, she will come, and you should give the robe.’ After the messenger has either personally given the instructions, or has sent others to give the instructions, he returns to the bhikkhunī, and says: ‘Venerable, I have instructed the manager you indicated to make a robe. When the venerable needs a robe, she should go and receive one. They should give the venerable a robe.’ When the bhikkhunī needs a robe, she should go to the manager and ask for the robe. She should say: ‘I need a robe. I need a robe.’ For a second and a third time, she should again say this. If she obtains the robe, it is fine. If she doesn’t obtain it, she may stand silently in front of the manager for a forth, fifth, and sixth time. If she obtains the robe, it is fine. If she doesn’t obtain it, and ask more times, if she then obtains the robe, it is a nissaggiya pācittiya. If she doesn’t obtain the robe, she should either go herself to the place from where the robe fund was sent, or send a messenger to say: ‘You sent a robe fund for bhikkhunī So-and-so. That bhikkhunī has not been able to use it in the end. You should know that, so it doesn’t cause you a loss.’ This procedure should be done thus."
