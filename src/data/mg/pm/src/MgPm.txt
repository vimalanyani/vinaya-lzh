<h2>Preliminaries</h2>
<lzh>阿梨耶僧聽。冬時一月過少一夜。餘有一夜三月在。老死至近佛法欲滅。諸阿梨耶。為得道故一心勤精進。所以者何。諸佛一心勤精進故得阿耨多羅三藐三菩提。何況餘助道法。未受具足者已出。僧今和合先作何事。<lzh-note>(一人應答布薩說戒)</lzh-note></lzh>
“Venerables, may the sangha listen. The first month of the winter season has already passed, except for one night. One night and three months remain. Old age and death are drawing near, and the Buddha’s dhamma will extinguish. Venerables, to realize the path, strive single-mindedly with diligence. Why? Because the Buddhas have striven single-mindedly with diligence, they’ve realized unsurpassed perfect enlightenment, let alone the other supporting path-factors. Those who haven’t received the full ordination yet have already left. The sangha is now in harmony. What are we doing first? (One person should answer: ‘The uposatha precepts’ recitation.’)

<lzh>諸阿梨耶不來。諸比丘尼說欲及清淨。</lzh>
Some venerables haven’t come. May the bhikkhunīs convey their consent and purity.

<h2>Introductory Verses</h2>

<lzh-verse>合十指爪掌　　供養釋師子
我今欲說戒　　僧當一心聽
乃至小罪中　　心應大怖畏
有罪一心悔　　後更莫復犯
心馬馳惡道　　放逸難禁制
佛說切戒行　　亦如利轡勒
佛口說教誡　　善者能信受
是人馬調順　　能破煩惱軍
若不受教勅　　亦不愛樂戒
是人馬不調　　沒在煩惱軍
若人守護戒　　如犛牛愛尾
繫心不放逸　　亦如猴著鎖
日夜勤精進　　求實智慧故
是人佛法中　　能得清淨命</lzh-verse>

<verse>
Joining the palms and the ten fingers together we venerate the Sakyan lion.

I now want to recite the precepts, may the sangha listen single-mindedly.

Even towards the small offenses, our hearts should feel great fear.

Having committed an offense, one should single-mindedly repent, and not transgress again later.

The horse-like mind runs down the evil paths, negligence is difficult to restrain.

The Buddha said that we must practise the precepts, as beneficial bridle and reins.

The Buddha gave these instructions, so that the good can attain faith.

That person is like an obedient horse, that can destroy the army of defilements.

If one doesn’t receive these teachings, and doesn’t feel love and happiness towards the precepts,

That person is like an untamed horse, that will founder against the army of defilements.

If someone protects the precepts like a yak its tail,

With their mind restrained without any negligence, like a locked-up monkey,

Making an intense effort day and night to seek true wisdom,

That person can attain a pure life in the Buddha’s dhamma.

</verse>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<lzh>諸阿梨耶僧聽。今十五日布薩說波羅提木叉。若僧時到。僧忍聽。相當一心共作布薩說波羅提木叉。白如是。諸阿梨耶。今共布薩說波羅提木叉。僧一心善聽。有罪者應發露。若無罪者默然。默然故當知諸阿梨耶清淨。如一一比丘尼問答。是比丘尼眾中三唱亦如是。若比丘尼。如是比丘尼眾中第二第三唱。憶有罪者不發露得故妄語罪。諸阿梨耶。故妄語罪佛說遮道法。比丘尼於是中欲求清淨。憶有罪應發露。發露則安隱。不發露罪益深。諸阿梨耶。已說波羅提木叉序。今問諸阿梨耶。是中清淨不。第二第三如是問。諸阿梨耶。是中清淨默然故。是事如是持。</lzh>
Venerables, may the sangha listen. Today is the uposatha of the 15th day, a pātimokkha recitation. If the right time has come for the sangha, the sangha should give their approval. It’s appropriate that we single-mindedly carry out the uposatha, and recite the pātimokkha together. This is the motion. Venerables, now we’ll do the uposatha, and recite the pātimokkha. May the sangha single-mindedly listen well. Those who have an offense should disclose it. If you’ve no offense, you should remain silent. By your silence I’ll know that the venerables are pure. When I call out three times in the midst of the bhikkhunī assembly, it’s the same as if the bhikkhunīs were cross-examined individually. If a bhikkhunī, when I call out like this in the midst of the bhikkhunī assembly a second and a third time, remembers that she has an offense, but doesn’t disclose it, she incurs the offense of intentional lying. Venerables, the Buddha has said that the offense of intentional lying is something that obstructs the path. A bhikkhunī who desires purification herein, and remembers an offense, should disclose it. Disclosing it leads to peace. Through hiding and not disclosing it, the offense increases. Venerables, I’ve recited the introduction to the pātimokkha. Now I ask the venerables: ‘Are you pure herein?’ A second and third time are asked in the same way. ‘The venerables are pure herein, therefore you’re silent. This matter is remembered thus.

<h2>Eight Pārājika Rules</h2>
<lzh>諸阿梨耶。是八波羅夷法。半月半月波羅提木叉。中說。</lzh>
Venerables, these eight pārājika rules are recited every half-month in the pātimokkha.

<lzh>placeholder</lzh>
<h3>Pārājika 1</h3>
<lzh>若比丘尼。於和合二部僧中受具足戒。不還戒。戒羸不出。相行婬法。乃至共畜生。是比丘尼犯波羅夷罪不應共住。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī who has received the full precepts in the midst of a harmonious twofold sangha, who hasn’t returned the precepts, who hasn’t disclosed her weakness in the precepts, engages in sexual intercourse, even together with an animal, that bhikkhunī commits a pārājika offense, and shouldn’t live in community.

<lzh>placeholder</lzh>
<h3>Pārājika 2</h3>
<lzh>若比丘尼。於聚落若空地。不與取隨盜。物王或捉或殺或縛或擯出言。咄女人。汝賊汝癡。比丘尼如是不與取波羅夷不應共住。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī in a village or the wilderness takes what isn’t given to steal it, an object for which the king would either arrest or kill or bind or exile her, saying: ‘Hey, woman! You criminal, you fool!,’—a bhikkhunī who in this way takes what isn’t given is pārājika, and shouldn’t live in community.

<lzh>placeholder</lzh>
<h3>Pārājika 3</h3>
<lzh>若比丘尼。自手奪人命。求持刀與殺者。教死歎死。咄人用惡活為死勝生。作如是意如是想。方便歎譽死快。因是死非餘。是比丘尼波羅夷不應共住。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī with her own hand takes someone’s life, seeks and takes a knife to give to an assassin, teaches death, or praises death, saying: ‘Hey you, what use is this bad life? Death is better than living on!,’ if, having such intentions and thoughts, she praises and glorifies the pleasure of death with skillful means, and someone dies for this reason and no other, that bhikkhunī is pārājika, and shouldn’t live in community.

<lzh>placeholder</lzh>
<h3>Pārājika 4</h3>
<lzh>若比丘尼。未知未了自稱得過人法聖知見殊勝。我如是知如是見。彼於後時若檢校若不檢校犯罪。欲求清淨故便作是言。阿梨耶。我不知言知不見言見。空誑不實語除增上慢。是比丘尼得波羅夷不應共住。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī, not knowing and understanding yet, claims to have attained a superhuman state, noble extraordinary knowledge and vision: ‘I know in this way, I see in this way,’ and at a later time, whether she’s being examined or not examined about committing the offense, desiring purification, she says: ‘Venerables, I, not knowing said I know, not seeing said I see. It was empty, deceited, untrue speech,’ except in a case of superiority conceit, that bhikkhunī incurs a pārājika, and shouldn’t live in community. 

<lzh>placeholder</lzh>
<h3>Pārājika 5</h3>
<lzh>若比丘尼漏心。漏心男子邊。肩以下膝以上摩觸受樂者。是比丘尼波羅夷不應共住。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī with a defiled mind, feels pleasure from being rubbed and touched below the shoulders and above the knees by a man with a defiled mind, that bhikkhunī is pārājika, and shouldn’t live in community.

<lzh>placeholder</lzh>
<h3>Pārājika 6</h3>
<lzh>若比丘尼漏心。漏心男子伸手內住共語。受捉手捉衣。來歡喜請坐。曲身就共期去。是比丘尼波羅夷不應共住。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī with a defiled mind stays within arm’s reach of a man with a defiled mind, talks with him, lets him hold her hand, hold her robes, is happy when he comes, asks him to sit down, turns her body, and goes to appointments with him, that bhikkhunī is pārājika, and shouldn’t live in community.

<lzh>placeholder</lzh>
<h3>Pārājika 7</h3>
<lzh>若比丘尼。知比丘犯重罪不向人說。是比丘尼若離處若死若罷道。後作是言。我先知是比丘尼犯重罪。不向人說。不欲令他知。是比丘尼波羅夷不應共住。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī knows that another bhikkhu[nī] has committed a grave offense, and doesn’t tell anyone, and if that second bhikkhunī leaves that place, or dies, or disrobes, she afterwards says: ‘I knew before that that bhikkhunī committed a grave offense, and didn’t tell anyone. I didn’t want to let others know,’ that bhikkhunī is pārājika, and shouldn’t live in community.

<lzh>placeholder</lzh>
<h3>Pārājika 8</h3>
<lzh>若比丘尼。知僧和合如法如比尼與比丘作舉羯磨。未作如法而隨順。諸比丘尼應諫是比丘尼。阿梨耶。是比丘。僧和合如法如比尼。作舉羯磨。未作如法莫隨順。是比丘尼。諸比丘尼諫時作是語。我不隨順誰當隨順。諸比丘尼如是第二第三諫。捨是事好。若不捨者。是比丘尼波羅夷不應共住。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī knows that the sangha in harmony has carried out an act of suspension against a bhikkhu according to dhamma and vinaya, and that he hasn’t acted according to dhamma yet, and follows him, the bhikkhunīs should admonish that bhikkhunī: ‘Venerable, the sangha in harmony has carried out an act of suspension against that bhikkhu according to dhamma and vinaya, and he hasn’t acted according to dhamma yet. Don’t follow him.’ If that bhikkhunī, when admonished by the bhikkhunīs, says: ‘If I don’t follow him, who will follow him?,’ the bhikkhunīs should admonish her like this a second and a third time. If she gives up this matter, it’s fine. If not, that bhikkhunī is pārājika, and shouldn’t live in community. 

<lzh>諸阿梨耶。已說八波羅夷法若比丘尼犯一一法。是比丘尼不應共住。如前後亦如是。比丘尼得波羅夷罪不應共住。今問諸阿梨耶。是中清淨不第二第三亦如是問諸阿梨耶。是中清淨默然故。是事如是持。</lzh>
Venerables, the eight pārājika rules have been recited. If a bhikkhunī has committed any of these offenses, she shouldn’t live in community. As before, so afterwards. That bhikkhunī incurs a pārājika offense, and shouldn’t live in community. Now I ask the venerables: ‘Are you pure herein?’ A second and third time are asked in the same way. ‘The venerables are pure herein, therefore you’re silent. This matter is remembered thus.

<h2>19 Saṅghādisesa Rules</h2>
<lzh>諸阿梨耶。是十九僧伽婆尸沙法。半月半月波羅提木叉中說。</lzh>
Venerables, these 19 saṅghādisesa rules are recited every half-month in the pātimokkha.

<lzh>placeholder</lzh>

If a bhikkhunī, out of hostility and dissatisfaction, slanders a bhikkhunī, who isn’t pārājika, with a pārājika offense because of a minor issue from a different matter, wanting to destroy her monastic life, and at a later time, whether examined or not examined about that minor issue from a different matter, that bhikkhunī says that she (spoke) because she harbored hostility, it’s an immediate saṅghādisesa offense.<note> “spoke” 說 is only found in the vibhaṅga version of the rule.</note>

<lzh>placeholder</lzh>

If a bhikkhunī knows that a woman has committed a crime, and that her assembled relatives want to punish her, and ordains her, except at a suitable time, —a suitable time means: if she has first been ordained by non-Buddhist renunciates. This is called ‘a suitable time’,— it’s an immediate saṅghādisesa offense.

<lzh>若比丘尼。於船渡處獨渡河者。是法初罪僧伽婆尸沙。</lzh>

<lzh>若比丘尼。知比丘尼僧和合如法比尼作舉羯磨。未作如法。先不語僧自與捨。是法初罪僧伽婆尸沙。(十事竟)</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī knows that the bhikkhunī sangha in harmony has carried out an act of suspension according to dhamma and vinaya (against someone) who hasn’t acted according to dhamma yet, and she herself lifts it, without first speaking with the sangha, it’s an immediate saṅghādisesa offense. (End of 10 rules.)

<lzh>placeholder</lzh>
<h3>Saṅghādisesa 11</h3>
<lzh>若比丘尼無漏心。漏心男子邊取衣鉢飲食疾病湯藥者。是法初罪僧伽婆尸沙。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī with an undefiled mind receives robes, bowls, drinks, food, liquid remedies and medicines for the sick from a man with a defiled mind, it’s an immediate saṅghādisesa offense.

If a bhikkhunī says to another bhikkhunī: ‘You can receive the offering of this man. Defiled or undefiled mind, how’s that your business? As long as you don’t have a defiled mind, you may accept the offering, and use it appropriately,’ the bhikkhunīs should admonish that bhikkhunī: ‘Don’t say: “You should receive the offering. A man’s defiled or undefiled mind, how’s that anyone’s business? Just make your mind undefiled, then you may accept the offering, and use it appropriately.” Like this she should be admonished a second and a third time. If she gives up this matter, it’s fine. If she doesn’t give it up, it’s a saṅghādisesa.<note> The vibhaṅga states that this is an immediate saṅghādisesa offense, even though it includes three admonishments. The pātimokkha doesn’t say whether it’s immediate or after three admonishments, which is very unusual. In the Sthāviravāda schools, the parallels to this rule are all immediate offenses. So it seems that this rule was later expanded to include three admonishments, but the text wasn’t fully adjusted.</note>

<lzh>placeholder</lzh>
<h3>Saṅghādisesa 13</h3>
<lzh>若比丘尼。欲破和合僧故。執持破僧事共諍。諸比丘尼應語是比丘尼。阿梨耶。莫破和合僧勤方便執持破僧事共諍。當與僧同事。何以故。僧和合歡喜不諍。共一學如水乳合。如法說安樂住。是比丘尼。諸比丘尼諫時。堅持不捨者。應第二第三諫。捨者善。若不捨者。是法乃至三諫。僧伽婆尸沙。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī, because she wants to split the sangha in harmony, strives with expedient means, holds on to matters which split the sangha, and quarrels with others, the bhikkhunīs should say to that bhikkhunī: ‘Venerable, don’t split the sangha in harmony by striving with expedient means, holding on to matters which split the sangha, and quarreling with others. You should conduct matters together with the sangha. Why? A sangha in harmony is happy and doesn’t quarrel. We should train together, mix like water and milk, speak according to dhamma, and live comfortably.’ If that bhikkhunī when admonished by the bhikkhunīs persists firmly, and doesn’t give it up, she should be admonished a second and a third time. If she gives up this matter, it’s fine. If not, this rule is a saṅghādisesa after three admonishments.

<lzh>placeholder</lzh>
<h3>Saṅghādisesa 14</h3>
<lzh>若諸比丘尼同意相助。若一若二若眾多。同語同見欲破和合僧。是比丘尼。諸比丘尼諫時。是同意比丘尼言。阿梨耶。莫說是比丘尼好惡。何以故。是法語比丘尼律語比丘尼。是比丘尼所說。皆是我等所欲。是比丘尼所見欲忍可事。我等亦欲忍可。是比丘尼知說非不知說。諸比丘尼應諫是同意比丘尼。阿梨耶莫作是語。法語比丘尼律語比丘尼。何以故。此非法語比丘尼律語比丘尼。阿梨耶。莫助破僧事當樂和合僧。何以故。僧和合歡喜不諍。共一學如水乳合。如法說安樂住。是比丘尼。諸比丘尼諫時。堅持不捨者。應第二第三諫。捨是事善。若不捨是法乃至三諫。僧伽婆尸沙。</lzh>
If bhikkhunīs with the same intentions help each other, whether one, two, or many, speaking in the same way and having the same views, wanting to split the sangha in harmony, and if, when the other bhikkhunīs admonish the bhikkhunī (of the previous rule), these bhikkhunīs with the same intentions say: ‘Venerables, don’t say whether that bhikkhunī is good or bad. Why? That bhikkhunī speaks the dhamma and the vinaya. Whatever that bhikkhunī says, is what we also wish for. That bhikkhunī’s views, and the things she wishes for and approve of, are what we also wish for and approve of. That bhikkhunī speaks with knowledge, not without knowledge,’ then the other bhikkhunīs should admonish the bhikkhunīs with the same intentions: ‘Venerables, don’t say: “That bhikkhunī speaks the dhamma and the vinaya.” Why? That bhikkhunī doesn’t speak the dhamma and the vinaya. Venerables, don’t support matters that split the sangha. You should take pleasure in harmony in the sangha. Why? A sangha in harmony is happy and doesn’t quarrel. We should train together, mix like water and milk, speak according to dhamma, and live comfortably.’ If these bhikkhunīs when admonished by the bhikkhunīs persist firmly, and don’t give it up, they should be admonished a second and a third time. If they give up this matter, it’s fine. If not, this rule is a saṅghādisesa after three admonishments.

<h3>Saṅghādisesa 15</h3>
<lzh>若比丘尼瞋恚非理謗僧。作如是言。僧隨愛隨瞋隨怖隨癡。僧依愛瞋怖癡。是故呵責。是比丘尼。諸比丘尼應諫作是言。阿梨耶。莫作是語。僧隨愛隨瞋隨怖隨癡。僧依愛瞋怖癡。何以故。僧不隨愛瞋怖癡。汝莫瞋恚非理謗僧。是比丘尼。諸比丘尼諫時。堅持不捨者。應第二第三諫。捨是事好。若不捨。是法乃至三諫。僧伽婆尸沙。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī resentfully and unreasonably slanders the sangha, saying: ‘The sangha follows desire, aversion, fear, and delusion. The sangha is relying on desire, aversion, fear, and delusion. For this reason they criticize me,’ the bhikkhunīs should admonish her: ‘Venerable, don’t say: “The sangha follows desire, aversion, fear, and delusion. The sangha is relying on desire, aversion, fear, and delusion.” Why? The sangha doesn’t follow desire, aversion, fear, and delusion. Don’t resentfully and unreasonably slander the sangha.’ If that bhikkhunī when admonished by the bhikkhunīs persists firmly, and doesn’t give it up, she should be admonished a second and a third time. If she gives up this matter, it’s fine. If not, this rule is a saṅghādisesa after three admonishments.

<h3>Saṅghādisesa 16</h3>
<lzh>若比丘尼。自用戾語。諸比丘尼共法中如法如律教。便自用意作是言。汝莫語我若好若惡。我亦不語汝若好若惡。諸比丘尼應諫彼比丘尼言。阿梨耶。諸比丘尼共法中如法如律教。汝莫自用語。諸比丘尼教汝。汝當信受。汝亦應如法如律教諸比丘尼。何以故。如來弟子中展轉相教展轉相諫。共罪中出故善法得增長。是比丘尼。諸比丘尼諫時。堅持不捨者。應第二第三諫。捨是事善。若不捨是法乃至三諫。僧伽婆尸沙。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī speaks obstinately and contrarily when bhikkhunīs of the same affiliation teach her in accordance with dhamma and vinaya, and with obstinate intentions, says: ‘Don’t say whether I’m good or bad. I also don’t say whether you’re good or bad,’ the bhikkhunīs should admonish that bhikkhunī: ‘Venerable, don’t speak obstinately when the bhikkhunīs of the same affiliation teach you according to dhamma and vinaya. When the bhikkhunīs teach you, you should accept it faithfully. You should also teach the bhikkhunīs according to dhamma and vinaya. Why? The disciples of the Tathāgata teach each other and admonish each other, to come out of shared offenses and to achieve growth in wholesome states.’ If that bhikkhunī when admonished by the bhikkhunīs persists firmly, and doesn’t give it up, she should be admonished a second and a third time. If she gives up this matter, it’s fine. If not, this rule is a saṅghādisesa after three admonishments.

<h3>Saṅghādisesa 17</h3>
<lzh>若二比丘尼習近住。迭相覆過。諸比丘尼應諫是比丘尼言。阿梨耶。莫習近住迭相覆過。習近住不生善法。是比丘尼。諸比丘尼諫時。堅持不捨應第二第三諫。捨是事善。若不捨是法乃至三諫。僧伽婆尸沙。</lzh>
If two bhikkhunīs live closely together, and hide each other’s transgressions, the bhikkhunīs should admonish those bhikkhunīs: ‘Venerables, don’t live closely together, and hide each other’s transgressions. Living closely together doesn’t give rise to wholesome states.’ If those bhikkhunīs, when admonished by the bhikkhunīs, persist firmly, and don’t give it up, they should be admonished a second and a third time. If they give up this matter, it’s fine. If not, this rule is a saṅghādisesa after three admonishments.

<h3>Saṅghādisesa 18</h3>
<lzh>若比丘尼見相遠住。便勸作是言。當習近住迭相藏過。莫相離住不妨生長善法。餘人亦有如是相近住者。僧不能遮。輕易汝故相禁制耳。諸比丘尼應諫是比丘尼言。阿梨耶。某甲某甲相遠住。莫勸習近住迭相覆過。習近住不妨生善法。莫作是語。餘人亦有習近住。僧不能遮。輕易汝故相禁制耳。是比丘尼。諸比丘尼諫時。堅持不捨者。應第二第三諫。捨是事善。若不捨者。是法乃至三諫。僧伽婆尸沙。</lzh>
If a bhikkhunī sees that they’re living apart from each other, and instructs them: ‘You should live closely together, and cover up each other’s offenses. Don’t live away from each other. It doesn’t obstruct the arising of wholesome states. There are also other people who live closely together like this, and the sangha is unable to stop them. It’s just because they don’t take you seriously that they restrain you,’ the bhikkhunīs should admonish that bhikkhunī: ‘Venerable, So-and-so and So-and-so live apart from each other. Don’t instruct them to live closely together, to hide each other’s transgressions, and (claim that) living closely together won’t obstruct the arising of wholesome states. Don’t say: “There are also other people who live closely together like this, and the sangha is unable to stop them. It’s just because they don’t take you seriously, that they restrain you.”’ If that bhikkhunī when admonished by the bhikkhunīs persists firmly, and doesn’t give it up, she should be admonished a second and a third time. If she gives it up, it’s fine. If not, this rule is a saṅghādisesa after three admonishments.

If a bhikkhunī resentfully wants to renounce the precepts, and says: ‘I renounce the Buddha, renounce the dhamma, renounce the sangha, renounce speaking, renounce living in community, renounce eating together, renounce the discourses and treatises, and renounce the Sakyan renunciates. What use are these Sakyan renunciates to me? There are other superior places. I’ll practise the monastic life there,’ the bhikkhunīs should admonish her: ‘Venerable, don’t resentfully renounce the precepts, and say: “I renounce the Buddha, … I renounce the Sakyan renunciates.” Renouncing the Buddha isn’t good.’ If she, when admonished by the bhikkhunīs like this, persists firmly, and doesn’t give it up, she should be admonished a second and a third time. If she gives up this matter, it’s fine. If not, this rule is a saṅghādisesa after three admonishments. (End of 19 rules.)

<lzh>諸阿梨耶已說十九僧伽婆尸沙法十一初罪八乃至三諫若比丘尼犯一一罪。半月二部眾中行摩那埵。次到阿浮呵那二十眾二部僧中應出罪。稱可眾人意。二十人中若少一人。此比丘尼不名出罪。諸比丘比丘尼應呵責。是名時。今問諸阿梨耶。是中清淨不。第二第三亦如是問。諸阿梨耶。是中清淨默然故。是事如是持。</lzh>
Venerables, the 19 saṅghādisesa rules have been recited; 11 immediate offenses and eight offenses after the third admonishment.<note> The vibhaṅga states that there are 12 immediate offenses and seven offenses after the third admonishment.</note> If a bhikkhunī has committed any of these offenses, she should undergo probation<note> Mānatta.</note> for half a month before both assemblies. She then reaches the rehabilitation<note> Abbhāna</note>. A sangha of 20 in both assemblies should rehabilitate her, if it pleases all the members of the assembly. If there’s one person less than 20, the bhikkhunī doesn’t count as rehabilitated, and the bhikkhus and bhikkhunīs should be criticized. This is called the suitable time. Now I ask the venerables: ‘Are you pure herein?’ A second and third time are asked in the same way. ‘The venerables are pure herein, therefore you’re silent. This matter is remembered thus.

If, for a bhikkhunī, a king or a high official sends a messenger with a robe fund to give to a bhikkhunī, and if that messenger, when they come to the bhikkhunī, say: ‘Venerable, this robe fund was sent by a king or a high official. Venerable, you should accept this robe fund,’ the bhikkhunī should say to the messenger: ‘Under the bhikkhunī rules, I shouldn’t accept this robe fund. When I need a robe, I obtain a pure cloth that I may accept with my own hands, make into a bhikkhunī robe, and keep.’ If the messenger then says to the bhikkhunī: ‘Venerable, is there a manager who always takes care of matters for the bhikkhunīs?’, the bhikkhunī should point out the manager, either a monastery attendant, or a lay person, to the messenger, or should tell them. When the messenger has gone there, he says: ‘It’d be good, manager, if you bought such-and-such a robe with such-and-such a robe fund for bhikkhunī So-and-so. When that bhikkhunī needs a robe, she’ll come, and you should give the robe.’ After the messenger has either personally given the instructions, or has sent others to give the instructions, he returns to the bhikkhunī, and says: ‘Venerable, I’ve instructed the manager you indicated to make a robe. When the venerable needs a robe, you should go and receive one. They should give the venerable a robe.’ When the bhikkhunī needs a robe, she should go to the manager and ask for the robe. She should say: ‘I need a robe. I need a robe.’ For a second and a third time, she should again say this. If she obtains the robe, it’s fine. If she doesn’t obtain it, she may stand silently in front of the manager for a forth, fifth, and sixth time. If she obtains the robe, it’s fine. If she doesn’t obtain it, and ask more times, if she then obtains the robe, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. If she doesn’t obtain the robe, she should either go herself to the place from where the robe fund was sent, or send a messenger to say: ‘You sent a robe fund for bhikkhunī So-and-so. That bhikkhunī hasn’t been able to use it in the end. You should know that, so it doesn’t cause you a loss.’ This procedure should be done thus.

One gone forth who disturbs others can’t be called a renunciate.

<lzh-verse>譬如明眼人　　能避嶮惡道
世有聰明人　　能遠離諸惡</lzh-verse>

<verse>
Just as a person with clear eyes can avoid the dangerous evil path,

There are wise people in the world who can keep away from evil.

<verse>
Without disturbing, without transgressing in speech, practising according to the laid-down precepts,

Knowing the right measure of food, always living happily in a remote place,

Dedicated to the happiness of samādhi, this is called the teaching of the Buddhas.

</verse>
<lzh>拘留孫佛如來應供正遍知。為寂靜僧最初說波羅提木叉。</lzh>

<verse>
Just as when bees collect from flowers, they don’t damage their color or scent,

Just taking their flavor they depart; A bhikkhu entering a village

Shouldn’t damage the affairs of others, and not observe what is or isn’t being done.

He should just contemplate his own bodily conduct, and carefully observe good and bad.

</verse>
<lzh>拘那含牟尼佛如來應供正遍知為寂靜僧最初說波羅提木叉。</lzh>

比丘護一切　　便得離眾苦
比丘守口意　　身不犯眾惡
是三業道淨　　得聖所得道
若人撾罵不還報　　於嫌恨人心不恨
於瞋人中心常淨　　見人為惡自不作
七佛為世尊　　能救護世間
是佛說戒經　　我已廣說竟
諸佛及弟子　　恭敬是戒經
恭敬戒經已　　各各相恭敬
慚愧得具足　　能得無為道</lzh-verse>

<verse>
Protecting the body is good, protecting the speech is also good,

Protecting the mind is good, protecting everything is good.

A bhikkhu who protects everything, will be free from many sufferings.

A bhikkhu who guards the speech, mind, and body, doesn’t commit many evils.

When these three courses of action are pure, one will attain the path attained by the noble ones. 

Not retaliating when people beat and scold, with a mind without hate towards hostile people,

With a mind ever pure among hateful people, on seeing others doing evil not doing it oneself.

The seven Buddhas honored by the world, capable of saving and protecting the world, 

These Buddhas spoke this precepts sutta, which I’ve now finished explaining in detail.

The Buddhas and their disciples venerated this precepts sutta.

Having venerated this precepts sutta, they venerated each other,

And having fully developed conscience and prudence, they could attain the path of nibbāna.
