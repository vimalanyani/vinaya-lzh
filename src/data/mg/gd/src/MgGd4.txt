<lzh>不先受者。</lzh>

<h2>Not to accept first.</h2>

<h2>Explanation</h2>

<lzh>比丘尼不先比丘受食房舍床褥。若有人請比丘尼食者。應語先請上尊眾。若言我於彼無敬心正欲請諸比丘尼者。應語我亦不受。若言我先已曾請僧前食後食。已曾共人請。未曾請諸尼。若爾者應受。下至先與僧一摶食者。比丘尼後得種種好食無罪。</lzh>

A bhikkhunī may not accept food, rooms and buildings, or beds and mats before a bhikkhu. If someone invites a bhikkhunī for a meal, she should say: “Invite the respected bhikkhu sangha first.” If they say: “I don’t have respect for them. I truly want to invite the bhikkhunīs,” she should say: “I also don’t accept it.” If they say: “I’ve previously already invited the (bhikkhu) sangha for breakfast and lunch. I’ve already invited them together with others, but I haven’t invited the bhikkhunīs yet,” in that case, she should accept it. Even if they just give the (bhikkhu) sangha one mouthful of food first, and the bhikkhunīs later receive all kinds of good food, there’s no offense. 


<lzh>若有人來言。我欲與尼作房。應語先與上尊眾作。若言我於彼無敬心正欲與尼作。應語我亦不受。若言我先已曾與僧作房舍講堂溫室食堂門屋井屋廁屋洗脚處屋。曾共眾人作。未曾為尼作。若爾者應受。下至先與僧一蚊厨。後比丘尼受大房無罪。</lzh>

If someone comes and says: “I want to build a building for the bhikkhunīs,” she should say: “Build one for the respected bhikkhu sangha first.” If they say: “I don’t have respect for them. I truly want to build it for the bhikkhunīs,” she should say: “I also don’t accept it.” If they say: “I’ve previously already built a building, a dhamma hall, a sauna, a refectory, a gate house, a roofed well, a toilet, or a roofed foot-washing place for the (bhikkhu) sangha. I’ve already built it together with a group of people, but I haven’t built something for the bhikkhunīs yet,” in that case, she may accept it. Even if they just build a bed<note>Pāli: mañca. Something seems to have been jumbled in this text, because a bed isn’t a building. In the Lokuttaravāda Sanskrit parallel, “mañca” is used as the example for the third category below, and doesn’t make sense here.</note> for the (bhikkhu) sangha first, and the bhikkhunīs later receive a large building, there’s no offense.


<lzh>若有人來與比丘尼床褥者。應語先與上尊眾。若言我於彼無敬心。應語我亦不受。若言我先已曾與比丘僧床褥枕俱執臥具。未曾與尼。若爾者得受。下至先與比丘僧一小床。比丘尼後受好床褥無罪。若檀越未曾飯僧施床褥。比丘尼先受者。越敬法。是名比丘尼不先受食床褥。第四敬法竟。</lzh>

If someone comes to give the bhikkhunīs beds and mats, she should say: “Give to the respected bhikkhu sangha first.” If they say: “I don’t have respect for them,” she should say: “I also don’t accept it.” If they say: “I’ve previously already given beds, mats, pillows, blankets, and other bedding to the (bhikkhu) sangha, but I haven’t given to the bhikkhunīs yet,” in that case, she may accept it. Even if they just gave a small bed to the (bhikkhu) sangha first, and the bhikkhunīs later receive good beds and mats, there’s no offense. If a supporter hasn’t offered food, or beds and mats to the (bhikkhu) sangha yet, and the bhikkhunīs accept it first, they transgress against this rule of respect. This is what is called “a bhikkhunī may not accept food, or beds and mats first.” The fourth rule of respect is finished.
