        "On the uposatha day, the bhikkhunīs should either go to the bhikkhu monastery as a whole sangha, or send a messenger. Having paid respect to the stupa, they / she should go to a bhikkhu who is a friend, and give their purity and consent: “The whole bhikkhunī sangha in harmony bows at the bhikkhu sangha’s feet. We ask about the uposatha, and invite instruction.” Like this, they / she should speak three times. When the sangha is doing the uposatha, the bhikkhu reciting the precepts should say: “May the venerable sangha listen. Now is the uposatha. So many days have passed, so many days remain. This is a procedure always followed by the sangha of the Buddha’s disciples. Some venerables haven’t come. The bhikkhus should announce their consent and purity. Who has received the consent of the bhikkhunīs?” The person who has received the bhikkhunī’s consent should go to the most senior monk, remove the robe from his right shoulder, and say with joined palms: “The bhikkhunī sangha in harmony bows at the bhikkhu sangha’s feet. They give purity and consent. They ask about the uposatha, and invite instruction.” Like this, he should speak three times. The precept-reciter should ask: “Who instructs the bhikkhunīs?” If there was an instructor before, then the reciter should ask him: “On which day shall the bhikkhunīs come to which place for the instruction?” The instructor should say: “On such-and-such a day, they should come to such-and-such a place.” If there’s no instructor, the bhikkhu who has received the bhikkhunī’s purity and consent before, should tell the bhikkhunīs: “Sisters, there’s no instructor. Be circumspect, don’t be negligent.” If a bhikkhu fulfills 12 requirements, the sangha should do a formal act (to appoint) him as instructor.",
        "Which 12? 1. He keeps the precepts. 2. He has heard much and hasn’t forgotten. 3. He remembers the vinaya in brief and with its detailed explanation. 4. He’s able to speak eloquently. 5. He trains in the precepts. 6. He trains in concentration. 7. He trains in wisdom. 8. He’s able to remove the unwholesome. 9. His celibacy is pure. 10) He hasn’t sexually harrassed a bhikkhunī. 11) He’s patient. 12) He has 20 years seniority or more. This is called fulfilling the 12 requirements.

        "When that bhikkhu has accepted the formal act, he should instruct the bhikkhunīs. There are eight criteria regarding the instruction in dhamma:",
        "Which eight? 1. The wrong time. 2. The wrong place. 3. Being too late. 4. Being too early. 5. Not in harmony. 6. Company. 7. Speaking long-windedly. 8. Welcoming instruction. “The wrong time” means instructing between sunset and before the next dawn. This is called the wrong time. If a bhikkhu instructs bhikkhunīs at the wrong time, it’s a pācittiya. “The wrong place” means that it may not be in an obscure or indecent place, nor in an open, exposed place. It should be in a place that’s neither obscure nor open, such as in a dhamma hall or under a tree. If a bhikkhu instructs bhikkhunīs at the wrong place, he breaks a minor vinaya rule. This is called the wrong place. “Being too late” means on the 14th or 15th day. This is called too late. “Being too early” means on the first, second, or third days of the month. This is called too early. One should go for instruction between the fourth and the 13th day. If someone instructs the bhikkhunīs too early, he breaks a minor vinaya rule. This is called too early. “Not in harmony” means when the bhikkhunī sangha isn’t in harmony, one shouldn’t instruct. After they’re in harmony, on should instruct. When the instructor has arrived, he should ask: “Is the bhikkhunī sangha in harmony?” If they say: “In harmony,” they should send a messenger to summon all the bhikkhunīs to come and listen to the instruction. If they’re old, sick, taking medicine, or making robes and bowls, and are unable to come, they should give consent. They should say this: “I, So-and-so, give consent to the instruction.” Like this, they should speak three times. If someone instructs a bhikkhunī sangha that isn’t in harmony, he breaks a minor vinaya rule. This is called not in harmony.",
        "“Company” means one may not instruct a part of the sangha. One should instruct after the whole bhikkhunī sangha is in harmony. This is called company. “Speaking long-windedly” means instructing the bhikkhunīs long-windedly like the venerable Nandaka. One should say: “Don’t do all evil, reverently practise all good, purify your mind, this is the teaching of the Buddhas. Sisters, this is the instruction. If you want to listen, then listen. If you want to go, then do as you please.” If a bhikkhu instructs the bhikkhunīs long-windedly, he breaks a minor vinaya rule. This is called the rule about speaking long-windedly. “The rule about welcoming the instructor” means that if bhikkhunīs stay in a town or village, and hear that the instructor bhikkhu will be coming on a certain day, if he has no attendants, they should ask some young bhikkhus to go out and welcome him carrying flowers, incense, banners, and an umbrella. If there aren’t any, they should do what is possible, even just put their palms together in respect, and carry his robes and bowl for him for one yojana or half a yojana, or for one kosa or half a kosa, or even just come out of the town or village to welcome him. If they don’t welcome him, they break a minor vinaya rule. When he has come, they should encourage people to donate by preparing breakfast, lunch, and afternoon tonics to offer zealously to him and his attendants for seven days without anything lacking.",
        "If people don’t offer, they should offer themselves by taking surplus from their own robes and bowl. If again there’sn’thing, they should at least pay respect with joined palms. “The rule about instructing the bhikkhunīs” means either in abhidhamma or in vinaya. “Abhidhamma” means the nine parts of the suttas. “Vinaya” means the pātimokkha in brief and with its detailed explanation. When the bhikkhunīs come, the instructor may not sit with his head bend downwards. He should observe their conduct. If he sees that someone has polished her head with oil, applied eye makeup, wears robes in strong colors, has pounded them to make them shiny, has tied a white belt around her hips, or similar things, he should criticize it. If she’s young, he should say: “Sister, you don’t train now. Are you waiting until you’re old to train? You’ll later teach and guide students. If you don’t train, then your students will also train with you to do the unwholesome. Therefore you should follow the training, and learn and chant the suttas.” If lay people are there, he may not teach her, so they won’t give rise to unwholesome mindstates, and say: “The renunciate teaches and admonishes his wife.” In such a situation he may not teach. He should ask the other bhikkhunīs: “This student lives with whom? This student depends on whom?” When he has asked, he should tell her preceptor and her teacher to teach and criticize her to make her follow and practise the dhamma, and not to let her conduct herself improperly. When a bhikkhu instructs the bhikkhunīs, he should think of them as women. The bhikkhunīs should think of the instructor as the Buddha. This is called asking about the uposatha and requesting instruction every half-month. The sixth rule of respect is finished."
