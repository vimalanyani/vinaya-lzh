        "A bhikkhunī may not accept food, rooms and buildings, or beds and mats before a bhikkhu. If someone invites a bhikkhunī for a meal, she should say: “Invite the respected bhikkhu sangha first.” If they say: “I don’t have respect for them. I truly want to invite the bhikkhunīs,” she should say: “I also don’t accept it.” If they say: “I’ve previously already invited the (bhikkhu) sangha for breakfast and lunch. I’ve already invited them together with others, but I haven’t yet invited the bhikkhunīs,” in that case, she should accept it. Even if they just give the (bhikkhu) sangha one mouthful of food first, and the bhikkhunīs later receive all kinds of good food, there is no offense.",
        "If someone comes and says: “I want to build a building for the bhikkhunīs,” she should say: “Build one for the respected bhikkhu sangha first.” If they say: “I don’t have respect for them. I truly want to build it for the bhikkhunīs,” she should say: “I also don’t accept it.” If they say: “I’ve previously already built a building, a dhamma hall, a sauna, a refectory, a gate house, a roofed well, a toilet, or a roofed foot-washing place for the (bhikkhu) sangha. I’ve already built it together with a group of people, but I haven’t yet built something for the bhikkhunīs,” in that case, she may accept it. Even if they just build a bed<note>Pāli: mañca. Something seems to have been jumbled in this text, because a bed isn’t a building. In the Lokuttaravāda Sanskrit parallel, “mañca” is used as the example for the third category below, and doesn’t make sense here.</note> for the (bhikkhu) sangha first, and the bhikkhunīs later receive a large building, there is no offense.",
