The Buddha was staying at Kapilavatthu in the Sakyan monastery. At that time, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī and 500 Sakyan women had gone forth in search of the Buddha. To be explained in detail as in the sutta. … The Buddha told the bhikkhunīs: “From now on, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī is the bhikkhunī sangha’s most senior nun. Remember it like this.” At that time, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī said to the Buddha: “World-honored One, you’ve laid down eight rules of respect for the bhikkhunīs.

<h2>Final Ruling</h2>


<lzh>比丘尼雖滿百臘。應向新受戒比丘起迎恭敬作禮。</lzh>

Even if a bhikkhunī has been ordained for 100 years, she should get up for, welcome, respect, and bow to a newly ordained bhikkhu. 




<h2>Explanation</h2>


<lzh>不得言待我百臘然後向新受戒比丘作禮。一切比丘尼應向長老中間年少比丘起迎恭敬作禮。若比丘尼至比丘精舍時。應頭面一一禮一切比丘足。若老病不能者。隨力多少禮。餘不遍者得總禮。應言我比丘尼某甲。頭面禮一切僧足。若比丘至比丘尼精舍時。一切比丘尼應起迎禮足。亦如上說。若比丘尼作是分別。是犯戒。是醫師。是摩訶羅無所知。憍慢不恭敬起迎作禮者。越敬法。第一敬法竟</lzh>

She may not say: “Wait until I’ve been ordained for 100 years, and then I’ll bow to a newly ordained bhikkhu.” All bhikkhunīs should get up for, welcome, respect, and bow to senior, middling, and young bhikkhus. If a bhikkhunī goes to a bhikkhu monastery, she should bow with her head at each bhikkhu’s feet one by one. If she’s old and sick, and not able to do it, she should bow as much as she’s capable to do. To the rest, she should bow together, and she should say: “I, bhikkhunī So-and-so, bow with my head at the whole sangha’s feet.” If a bhikkhu goes to a bhikkhunī monastery, all bhikkhunīs should get up, welcome him, and bow at his feet. As explained above as well. If a bhikkhunī makes such distinctions: “He has broken a precept, he acts as a doctor, he’s an old man without any knowledge,” and out of conceit, she’s disrespectful, doesn’t get up, doesn’t welcome him, and doesn’t bow, she transgresses against this rule of respect. The first rule of respect is finished.
